The comma after \"6th\" is a stylistic choice that is commonly used in 18th-century texts to separate the date from the year, enhancing clarity. However, the year '175' appears to be incomplete, as it likely should be '1750' or '1751', depending on the context. This uncertainty about the year slightly lowers the confidence score, as the correction does not fully resolve the potential ambiguity regarding the year.

Additionally, the phrase \"of the Virginia\" is simplified to \"of Virginia,\" which is more grammatically correct and aligns with common usage.
