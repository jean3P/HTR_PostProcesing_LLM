However, the phrase \"To soon\" could be interpreted as a misplacement of \"too soon,\" which would change the meaning slightly. Given the context of 18th-century writing, the phrase \"too soon\" might be more appropriate if the intent was to indicate timing.

The correction of \"Wagons\" to \"Waggons\" aligns with the period's spelling conventions, where \"waggon\" was often used. The word \"cary\" is correctly corrected to \"carry,\" which is the proper spelling.

The correction to 'p. good.' aligns with the context of 18th-century text, where 'p.' could stand for 'per' or 'page,' making the phrase plausible. However, without additional context, there remains a slight uncertainty regarding the exact intended word, hence the score is not a full 100. Overall, the correction is highly likely to be accurate, justifying a high confidence score."
