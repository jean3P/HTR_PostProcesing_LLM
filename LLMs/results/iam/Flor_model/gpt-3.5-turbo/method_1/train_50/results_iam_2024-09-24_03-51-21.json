The corrected text line 'this had already happened half a dozen times.' makes more sense in the context of the sentence and is grammatically correct. The corrections are straightforward and align with common language usage from the 18th century. The only reason for not giving a perfect score is the slight difference in the number of occurrences mentioned (from 'dorentimes' to 'half a dozen times'), but this does not significantly impact the overall accuracy of the correction."
