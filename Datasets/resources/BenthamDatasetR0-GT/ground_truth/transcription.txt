071_167_001_05_01 Note from p .
071_167_001_05_02 [ ( b ) Renewed ] Upon every fresh coinage the government , it is true ,
071_167_001_05_03 will be put to two great charges , 1 . The Loss upon the wear and
071_167_001_05_04 the debasement . 2 . The expence of the Operation .
071_167_001_05_05 But the first Loss must be born by somebody : and it
071_167_001_05_06 is better it should be born by the state , than by individuals . It
071_167_001_05_07 is better , for the same reason that Inssurance Offices are beneficial .
071_167_001_05_08 The burthen by being reduced as it were to impalpable parcels
071_167_001_05_09 is lessened upon the whole . Besides the oftner the experience comes
071_167_001_05_10 round the less it will be ; and that not only each time , but even
071_167_001_05_11 upon the whole . If the Coinage is renewed for instance every

072_095_001_04_01 divisions that have been given in several cases by
072_095_001_04_02 English Lawyers would have been Theft . too ! It is
072_095_001_04_03 however according to the only notion that can be assigned
072_095_001_04_04 to the word embezzlement destinct from that of Theft
072_095_001_04_05 it is I say but embezzlement for as to the taking ,
072_095_001_04_06 the beginning to occupy , the putting the spoon to his
072_095_001_04_07 mouth and so forth he had a title . But in these two
072_095_001_04_08 cases too what difference is there in the demand for
072_095_001_04_09 punishment ?
072_095_001_04_10 A man seeing a horse exposed to sale watches
072_095_001_04_11 his opportunity mounts the horse and runs away with
072_095_001_04_12 is will
072_095_001_04_13 it . This what every body may call Theft . If instead of
072_095_001_04_14 taking the horse in this clandestine manner by sur=
072_095_001_04_15 =prize he had got the owner ' s leave to mount on its
072_095_001_04_16 back on pretence of trying its paces , this too according
072_095_001_04_17 to decisions that have been given by English Lawyers
072_095_001_04_18 would have been Theft for they saw plainly that in point
072_095_001_04_19 of mischief there was no difference
072_095_001_04_20 such an act as this and an Theft . would just

071_162_002_04_04 was not executed , or alters a document which has been executed by
071_162_002_04_05 the proper person , he commits in either case , a particular kind
071_162_002_04_06 of Forgery . The profit arises from the difference in point of
071_162_002_04_07 value , between the counterfeit or diminished Coin , and the
071_162_002_04_08 genuine or entire , for which it is intended to be passed .
071_162_002_04_09 This offence has commonly been stiled Treason , and ,
071_162_002_04_10 in many respects , treated as if it were so . But with as much
071_162_002_04_11 propriety it might have been called by any other odious

071_162_002_04_14 to usurp power , but property . It is not like Treason the Crime
071_162_002_04_15 of the Courtier or of the Soldier or of the Lawyer : but of the Ar=

116_287_001_03_02 expediency is , that is aimed at , or even compassed , at the
116_287_001_03_03 expence of that superior expediency , which follows with or
116_287_001_03_04 without being looked for _ in the train of justice . _
116_287_001_03_05 According to this false rule , such arrangements should
116_287_001_03_06 have been taken , as should have had for their object the
116_287_001_03_07 effectual prevention of the return of every individual Convict
116_287_001_03_08 that had ever been consigned to that scene of intended annihi-
116_287_001_03_09 -lation : and that as well at all times from and after the
116_287_001_03_10 expiration of his legal terms of punishment , as before it . _
116_287_001_03_11 I say every Convict : for what individual Convict breathing
116_287_001_03_12 ought ever to have been suffered to return ? An ill behaved
116_287_001_03_13 man ? Then what becomes of the Mother Country and its security ?
116_287_001_03_14 A well behaved man ? then what becomes of the economy of
116_287_001_03_15 the settlement , and the only chance it has of contributing any
116_287_001_03_16 thing , in some distant Century , to the object of Reformation ? _
116_287_001_03_17 These being the two plans _ grounded on the two rival
116_287_001_03_18 principles _ one of them alone consistent with justice and ulti-
116_287_001_03_19 -mate utility _ each consistent with its own principle _ which
116_287_001_03_20 was the plan actually pursued ? The answer has been
116_287_001_03_21 already given : For years together , neither the one nor the other ,
116_287_001_03_22 nor any plan at all : at length _ when every thing that
116_287_001_03_23 would have been presented to a capable mind by forecast , had
116_287_001_03_24 been forced upon incapable minds by experience _ the unjust
116_287_001_03_25 u
116_287_001_03_26 one . For years together , they had not so much as began to
116_287_001_03_27 think : and the moment they did begin to think , their
116_287_001_03_28 thoughts were bent upon injustice . _

116_066_001_02_03 " the soldiers rushed in to save the life of Cole-be . His conduct
116_066_001_02_04 " here became inexplicable . On a sudden , he chose to be in a rage
116_066_001_02_05 " at something or other , and , threw a spear among the soldiers ,
116_066_001_02_06 " which dreadfully took effect on one of them , entering at his back
116_066_001_02_07 " and coming out at the belly , close to the navel...... .

116_066_001_02_09 " or shewing the least gratitude for the attentions which he received ,
116_066_001_02_10 " from every one , has become a most insolent and troublesome
116_066_001_02_11 " savage . As it was impossible sometimes to avoid censuring
116_066_001_02_12 " him for his conduilt conduct , he had been known to walk
116_066_001_02_13 " about armed , and heard to declare it was for the express
116_066_001_02_14 " purpose of spearing the governor whenever he saw him . " _
116_066_001_02_15 10 P.196 . January 1799 . [ A man was " sentenced to receive a
116_066_001_02_16 " severe corporal punishment , for having shot a native ( man )
116_066_001_02_17 " at Botany Bay . Could the evidence of some of these people have
116_066_001_02_18 " been taken , it was supposed that he would have been capitally
116_066_001_02_19 " convicted , in which case he would certainly have suffered , the
116_066_001_02_20 " governor being determined to put that article of his Majesty ' s

116_066_001_02_25 " When this man was brought out to be punished , several of

116_632_002_02_04 it is up high in favour : and - what is beyond
116_632_002_02_05 every thing , and without which every thing else would
116_632_002_02_06 be as nothing - there is no Gospel - propagating Lord-
116_632_002_02_07 no friend of the " great person ' s " to steal up the back
116_632_002_02_08 staircase and whisper in his ear -up or not up
116_632_002_02_09 the spot is too near me _ it must not be made

116_632_002_02_12 ( _ I mean the worthy Magistrate _ ) It is a yet but
116_632_002_02_13 a hypothetical one : - let him convert it into a cate-
116_632_002_02_14 -gorical one : accepted or not by the County , he has
116_632_002_02_15 nothing to fear from great persons , so long as he
116_632_002_02_16 can keep himself from " flattery " . _ As to the £400
116_632_002_02_17 a Year Your Lordship and he together will be able
116_632_002_02_18 to find a use for it : _ it will sever with in a
116_632_002_02_19 trifle for a place of Inspector of Prisons ; to smell
116_632_002_02_20 at the same nosegay with the Inspector of Hulks
116_632_002_02_21 who will come on the carpet presently : - it will

116_632_002_02_23 protegé of the worthy Magistrates , I mean the so

071_108_001_03_01 Of Matrimonial Desertion .
071_108_001_04_01 It is a hard and not an uncommon case where in
071_108_001_04_02 a married couple either party betakes himself or herself out of
071_108_001_04_03 the reach or knowledge of the other . Such a breach of the marriage
071_108_001_04_04 contract may be termed Matrimonial Dessertion .
071_108_001_04_05 This case is the more distressing in as much as the par=
071_108_001_04_06 =ty deserted may remain deprived of the comforts of matrimony
071_108_001_04_07 not only during the life of the deserter , but forever after . As
071_108_001_04_08 the desserter lived concealed so also may he die .

116_620_001_03_02 from
116_620_001_03_03 a letter from to his Grace to the Treasury dated
116_620_001_03_04 the 27th of the preceding month " desiring to be
116_620_001_03_05 " apprized of the number of Convicts which the
116_620_001_03_06 " Panopticon . . . . is intended to accommodate " : and
116_620_001_03_07 is the letter that constituted or at least helped
116_620_001_03_08 to constitute the ground of the just-quoted
116_620_001_03_09 Treasury letter , written 5 months and 8 days
116_620_001_03_10 after the letter it was thus grounded upon ,
116_620_001_03_11 and some time ( but I do not exactly know
116_620_001_03_12 how long ) after the determination had been taken
116_620_001_03_13 by mMost Noble and Right Honourable persons ,
116_620_001_03_14 that no such building as it thus called upon
116_620_001_03_15 me to make pr preparations for , should be
116_620_001_03_16 erected . _
116_620_001_03_17 After stating , in regard to the object of the
116_620_001_03_18 Act in question ( the Act of 1794 for the erection
116_620_001_03_19 of the Panopticon Penitentiary House requiring as

071_042_001_03_01 Servants Law
071_042_001_04_01 A servant ought to behave with the same humility
071_042_001_04_02 and deference to every gentleman as to his own mas=
071_042_001_04_03 =ter , in every thing that is not incompetable with
071_042_001_04_04 his duty to his master .
071_042_001_04_05 If a menial servant or day labourer behave in an
071_042_001_04_06 affrontive manner to a gentleman the gentleman
071_042_001_04_07 may give him moderate chastisement on the spot
071_042_001_04_08 and such chastisement shall not justify the servant for
071_042_001_04_09 assaulting the gentleman in return if he can save himself by
071_042_001_04_10 flight ; unless it be to save himself from receiving irreparable
071_042_001_04_11 damage
071_042_001_04_12 Reasons
071_042_001_04_13 A servant has been trained up in the habit of subm=
071_042_001_04_14 =ission and obedience ( they are among the necessary duties
071_042_001_04_15 of his calling . ) A gentleman is that of independence .
071_042_001_04_16 It is much less painful therefore for a servant to digest an
071_042_001_04_17 affront even from one of his own rank than it is to a gentleman
071_042_001_04_18 much more an affront from a gentleman : A blow from a

115_111_003_02_01 grounded his recent Proposal for the lodging of
115_111_003_02_02 Supernumeraries . " Give me for only two years what
115_111_003_02_03 " you are now giving to Mr Campbel , viz : 21 a
115_111_003_02_04 " man , for every subsequent year I will maintain
115_111_003_02_05 " them forever after at my own price of 12 . "
115_111_003_02_06 What then will it cost Government , even for these
115_111_003_02_07 two years , to give them to Mr Bentham rather
115_111_003_02_08 than Mr Campbel ? Not a penny . For every
115_111_003_02_09 year after the two years , the saving here too is 9 .
115_111_003_02_10 Here then is an annuity of 9 for every Convict obtain-
115_111_003_02_11 -ed by Government for nothing . Such is the hard-
115_111_003_02_12 -ship to Government upon this score . What would
115_111_003_02_13 Government have had to pay , if it had gone to work
115_111_003_02_14 and built a Penitentiary House for these supernume-
115_111_003_02_15 -raries upon the common plan ? A second Penitent-
115_111_003_02_16 -iary House could not be built for half a dozen or a
115_111_003_02_17 dozen supernumeraries as they happen to be brought
115_111_003_02_18 in : and upon the common plans not a single super-
115_111_003_02_19 -numerary could be taken in to the first house .
115_111_003_02_20 The second must be built for the greatest probable
115_111_003_02_21 number , say 1000 . With the benefit of Mr Black-
115_111_003_02_22 -burne ' s frugality a Penitentiary House for a thousand
115_111_003_02_23 could not be had for so little as 200,000 . It might
115_111_003_02_24 now be had ( say ) for 100,000 . But for one reason
115_111_003_02_25 or other ( such as diminution in the number of
115_111_003_02_26 Criminals , improvement of the County Prisons ,
115_111_003_02_27 extension
115_108_002_01_01 but whose Successor is so .
115_108_002_01_02 The Insurance as now proposed by Mr . B .
115_108_002_01_03 would be infinitely too disadvantageous to the
115_108_002_01_04 public , the Major part of those that die within
115_108_002_01_05 the Bills of Mortality are within the Age of
115_108_002_01_06 10 years , & Mr . B . will scarcely have any
115_108_002_01_07 person within that Age delivered to his Care .
115_108_002_01_08 The whole Article had better be omitted , or the
115_108_002_01_09 Estimate made so as to exclude all persons
115_108_002_01_10 under ten years old .
115_108_002_01_11 A Report is to be made by the Governor
115_108_002_01_12 to the Court of King ' s Bench on the first day of
115_108_002_01_13 every Term , & the Court is to give such orders
115_108_002_01_14 thereupon as shall be judged proper , but there
115_108_002_01_15 is no provision made in case the Governor
115_108_002_01_16 should refuse to obey such Orders , & as he
115_108_002_01_17 cannot under this Contract be turned out of
115_108_002_01_18 his Office , no remedy can be administered to
115_108_002_01_19 his neglect or refusal . In order to make
115_108_002_01_20 this Article of force , the Governor should
115_108_002_01_21 enter into a Bond , conditioned , in a large
115_108_002_01_22 Sum , to abide by such orders , as the Court
115_108_002_01_23 of King ' s Bench should issue to him , upon an

072_168_003_04_01 the presence of another is more or less injurious according as it
072_168_003_04_02 is more or less material to the party injured to stand well
072_168_003_04_03 in the esteem of such third person .
072_168_003_04_04 Also , according as from the sex , age , profession , or
072_168_003_04_05 other circumstances belonging to that person , the party injured
072_168_003_04_06 is likely to suffer more or less in his good opinion from
072_168_003_04_07 such a cause .
072_168_003_04_08 A personal Insult , the more public it is , the more
072_168_003_04_09 injurious . It is the more public the greater the number is of
072_168_003_04_10 the persons in whose presence it is offered ; and the greater the
072_168_003_04_11 number of other persons is , to whom by means of such
072_168_003_04_12 eye-witnesses it comes to be or is likely to be made

072_168_003_04_14 To a gentleman , money alone is never to be deemed

115_075_003_02_17 and even make amends in most instances for any accident of its

115_075_003_02_23 encreasing according to the number of years during which
115_075_003_02_24 such felon shall have been under the care of the said intend-

115_075_003_02_26 by the injury from such felony , except that the same shall
115_075_003_02_27 not exceed £5 , should such felon have been one full year

072_102_004_05_03 is to prevent the Judge from obtaining the knowledge he must possess ,
072_102_004_05_04 in order to do Justice upon the Offender : of the three last to prevent
072_102_004_05_05 his having the power . Now if in any case the Judge can be prevented from
072_102_004_05_06 doing Justice , it can only be ( as we shall see more particularly hereafter )
072_102_004_05_07 by depriving him of one or other of these qualifications , the knowledge ;
072_102_004_05_08 the inclination or the power . But the inclination in a case like this is out of
072_102_004_05_09 the question . It appears therefore that these can be no other signs of a man ' s

072_102_003_04_02 requisite in order for a person in whose possession or custody the
072_102_003_04_03 thing is to know the fact of its being taken . As if a man going
072_102_003_04_04 into a Shop where he is not known or even where he is known ,
072_102_003_04_05 lays hold of any Article , and without telling the shopman or
072_102_003_04_06 otherwise giving him notice puts it in his pocket and departs .
072_102_003_04_07 Much more if he takes measures to prevent its being known :
072_102_003_04_08 as if upon being asked whether he has taken it , he denies it .
072_102_003_04_09 2 . If he omits to take such measures as he has reason to

072_102_003_04_14 By a stranger in this case is meant any one who has
072_102_003_04_15 no reason to think himself already known to the owner in such
072_102_003_04_16 manner as to be made amenable if it was before the owner ' s
072_102_003_04_17 face that it was taken , or to any one who would be expected of

071_146_002_04_02 [ ( A ) Suggestions ] It matters not in what manner
071_146_002_04_03 those suggestions were made : whether in discourse

071_146_002_04_14 of any fact , which , according to the usages that
071_146_002_04_15 prevail , would naturally be presumed , unless it
071_146_002_04_16 were disaffirmed by the offender .
071_146_002_05_01 2 . Accordingly cheating a person out of any
071_146_002_05_02 thing at play , that is , at any game or wager
071_146_002_05_03 of sports , is sharping . ( a )

071_032_002_04_09 From circumstances such as these either singly or
071_032_002_04_10 in conjunction , it may appear clearly that the mischief
071_032_002_04_11 that happened was the very mischief that was intended .
071_032_002_04_12 7
071_032_002_04_13 for instance
071_032_002_04_14 But in such cases as where the mischief was done by
071_032_002_04_15 shooting at a distance , or by a wound given in a Scuf=

071_141_003_04_03 2 . It is to be presumed that the intention
071_141_003_04_04 was to endanger human life if the offender
071_141_003_04_05 had good reason to think that such would
071_141_003_04_06 be the consequence . As if fire were applied
071_141_003_04_07 to a House or other dwelling in the time of
071_141_003_04_08 sleep , or if at any other time a person were
071_141_003_04_09 confined to a room within the reach of the
071_141_003_04_10 fire .
071_141_003_04_11 [ ( E ) £S , 100 ] 1 . If it be to an amount short
071_141_003_04_12 of this it is only criminal devastation .
071_141_003_04_13 2 . Whether it were the intention of
071_141_003_04_14 the offender to do mischief to so great an amount
071_141_003_04_15 or not is to be collected from the circumstances
071_141_003_04_16 of the place : such as the quantity of building
071_141_003_04_17 contiguous or near adjacent : as if it be in
071_141_003_04_18 the street of a town or village ; or even in a
071_141_003_04_19 House standing by itself , if the value of it
071_141_003_04_20 together with its contents be to that amount .

071_032_001_04_15 such as gave him an interest which no other injury
071_032_001_04_16 but that which eventually took place would accomplish :
071_032_001_04_17 as if the man disabled or mutilated were one to whom

071_044_003_04_12 it he denies it : and this Nor does it matter whether

116_291_001_03_05 Expirees was for the first time brought upon the carpet being
116_291_001_03_06 explained , I proceed to collect the manifestations that occurr
116_291_001_03_07 of the conduct observed by the local government in relation to it .
116_291_001_03_08 In this little piece of history , it will be necessary to
116_291_001_03_09 distinguish two periods : the one preceding the point of time at
116_291_001_03_10 which the first intimation of the intentions of Administration
116_291_001_03_11 here at home in relation to the liberty in question appears ( as far
116_291_001_03_12 as the information extends ) to have been received : the other sub-
116_291_001_03_13 -sequent to it .

116_291_001_04_01 ( )
116_291_001_04_02 In the anecdote , besides the main point , we see another ex-
116_291_001_04_03 -emplification of the spirit of injustice with which the whole system
116_291_001_04_04 is impregnated . It was not enough to stretch into a perpetual
116_291_001_04_05 punishment a punishment of which there remained but two
116_291_001_04_06 years fourteen or seven years - the same extension was here
116_291_001_04_07 given to a punishment of which there remained but two
116_291_001_04_08 years . An account of a set of extensions more or less nume-
116_291_001_04_09 -rous , in the same strain , but some of them ( I understand )
116_291_001_04_10 barbarous in the degree , will be among the account which Your
116_291_001_04_11 have
116_291_001_04_12 Lordship ' s Most Noble predecessor will one day perhaps to give . In
116_291_001_04_13 some recent instances , Convicts whose confinement in New South
116_291_001_04_14 Wales would have become illegal almost as soon as it would
116_291_001_04_15 have commenced , were liberated at the indication of a person very
116_291_001_04_16 near to me , from the oppression to which they had been doomed
116_291_001_04_17 under the auspice of his Grace : and I had the satisfaction
116_291_001_04_18 to learn that it was to Your Lordship ' s justice , that he is
116_291_001_04_19 indebted for the few items struck out of the catalogue of his
116_291_001_04_20 res gestae , in a relation to this his " improved Colony . "

116_073_001_02_02 " in the public stores rendering it necessary to deduct two pounds
116_073_001_02_03 " from the twelve which were issued , addition was made to the
116_073_001_02_04 " weekly allowance of salt meat , eight pounds and a half of beef
116_073_001_02_05 " being issued in lieu of five , and five pounds of port in lieu
116_073_001_02_06 " of three . This alteration was to continue until the new crops

116_073_001_02_10 " to time attended the exertions of the industrious in agriculture ,
116_073_001_02_11 " being , it was hoped , now at an end , the governor , conceiving it
116_073_001_02_12 " to be no longer consistent with his duty to continue the original
116_073_001_02_13 " prices of grain , directed in future that the following should be
116_073_001_02_14 " given , viz .
116_073_001_02_15 " For wheat , per bushel _ _ 8 shillings .

116_073_001_02_17 " And for maize , do . _ _ _ 4 ditto .
116_073_001_02_18 " which prices were to commence on the first day of January
116_073_001_02_19 " 1800 .
116_073_001_02_20 " The scarcity of wheat in the public store was occasioned
116_073_001_02_21 " by the unbounded extravagance of the labouring people , who had ,
116_073_001_02_22 " in consequence of the last unproductive season , reduced those
116_073_001_02_23 " who supported themselves to very great distress ; and several
116_073_001_02_24 " persons , who sometime since would gladly have sent their wheat
116_073_001_02_25 " to the store at the established price , had now refused it , when
116_073_001_02_26 " the store was capable of receiving it ; and , taking advantage of
116_073_001_02_27 " the scarcity which they themselves had occasioned , had raised the
116_073_001_02_28 " p price of wheat £1..10s per bushel ; a shameful extortion ! "

116_625_001_02_01 * that this plan of the Duke of Portland ' s for crowding
116_625_001_02_02 Gaols and taxing Counties was not in every point of view
116_625_001_02_03 a new one , appears from a Memorial presented by the
116_625_001_02_04 Middlesex Justices to his Grace about 16 Months before , on the
116_625_001_02_05 subject of the State Prisoners committed to Cold Bath Fields .
116_625_001_02_06 The Memorial is printed at length in the " Papers presented
116_625_001_02_07 " to the House of Commons relative to his Majesty ' s Prison
116_625_001_02_08 " in Cold Bath Fields " . Ordered b to be printed 18 , Decr 1800 . pp 78 , 79 .

116_625_001_02_10 " Middlesex .. . do .. . humbly entreat Your Grace to take into
116_625_001_02_11 " consideration the difficulties under which they labour ; which
116_625_001_02_12 " are yet farther encreased by the addition of so great a
116_625_001_02_13 " number of Prisoners of the above description " [ State Pri-
116_625_001_02_14 -soners ] " to those whom the House of Correction was originally
116_625_001_02_15 " intended to receive , and with which it is crowded to
116_625_001_02_16 " a great degree of inconvenience ... .

116_625_001_02_18 " additional expence has been incurred , on account of Pri-

116_625_001_02_20 " the various Burthens upon the County Rate , are already

116_625_001_02_23 " but this Expence the Magistrates confidently hoped will
116_625_001_02_24 " be reimbursed to the County , on a fair statement of the
116_625_001_02_25 " several Particulars " . -
116_625_001_02_26 From the so often mentioned posterior letter of his
116_625_001_02_27 Grace ' s , which I have had the honour to bring to light ,
116_625_001_02_28 information in no small degree interesting may now be
116_625_001_02_29 derived by these same Magistrates . In May 1798 they
116_625_001_02_30 complain of the " crowding " of their Gaol with Prisoners
116_625_001_02_31 not intended for it , speak of inconvenience , assume ( as
116_625_001_02_32 was but natural ) that the inconvenience was , as such ,
116_625_001_02_33 unintentional on the part of the Duke , and , in mentioning
116_625_001_02_34 it in that character , conceive that the consideration thus
116_625_001_02_35 submitted to that Noble person ' s will , in the character of
116_625_001_02_36 a motive , give birth in his Grace ' s mind to a determination
116_625_001_02_37 to grant the relief they pra pray for . Little did they expect
116_625_001_02_38 to see the day , & that so early a one , in which by a document
116_625_001_02_39 under
116_294_002_01_01 18
116_294_002_02_01 exhilerating assurance , and afterwards , by instruction from his
116_294_002_02_02 superiors , have found himself compelled to revoke it , and had
116_294_002_02_03 revoked it accordingly , the case would have been intelligible e-
116_294_002_02_04 -nough . But here no such assurance is given until the very
116_294_002_02_05 time when , spontaneously or under instructions , a resolution is
116_294_002_02_06 taken not to fulfill it .
116_294_002_02_07 N . 10 ( p . 268 ) Feb 1793 . At this time the expectation about
116_294_002_02_08 " the clause .. . in the chapter party " for preventing Shipmasters from
116_294_002_02_09 " receiving any person " whatever on board " from the Colony , without
116_294_002_02_10 " the express consent and order of the Governor " was found to be
116_294_002_02_11 l
116_294_002_02_12 realized . The Bel ona , arrived 15th January 1793 came provided
116_294_002_02_13 with this clause . She had sailed from England on the 8th of
116_294_002_02_14 August 1792 . The " improved " Colony was thus improved into
116_294_002_02_15 a pretty compleat Bastile : a key only being put into the
116_294_002_02_16 hand of the Governor with liberty to let loose any person whom
116_294_002_02_17 he might be induced to favour . Into the jaws of this Bastile
116_294_002_02_18 came out by this same vessel several free and honest families .
116_294_002_02_19 They had been inveigled hither by conditions held out by govern-
116_294_002_02_20 -ment . These conditions are stated by Captain Collins ( p . 267 . )
116_294_002_02_21 Among these conditions I do not observe that of being dependent
116_294_002_02_22 for their return on the arbitrary will and pleasure of a suc-
116_294_002_02_23 -cession of unknown Governors , the instruments of an arbitrary
116_294_002_02_24 and perfidious Minister and his successors.-
116_294_002_02_25 N . 11 ( p . 268 ) 19th February 1792 . The sincerity of the assurance
116_294_002_02_26 given in the preceding August , as mentioned in N . 9 , began
116_294_002_02_27 now to manifest itself . On this day sailed for Canton this
116_294_002_02_28 same ship the Bellona . Into this ship had been received six
116_294_002_02_29 persons from the settlement : two of them expirees , by permission :
116_294_002_02_30 two other Expirees also , but without permission : as likewise

071_169_004_05_05 to draw the same inference in all cases that can ever happen ?

071_169_004_05_10 : most any other country is that disposition to mercy of the prevalence
071_169_004_05_11 of which every man is pretty well assured in the tribunal which is
071_169_004_05_12 to try him . A man will think himself pretty secure , and in gene=
071_169_004_05_13 in fact
071_169_004_05_14 : ral will be pretty secure , that no Jury , unless they thought him
071_169_004_05_15 concerned with Coiners , would every convict him on such a Law ; nor
071_169_004_05_16 any Judge , who was not of the same opinion , let him suffer for it
071_169_004_05_17 though he were convicted . But that security , though a very good one
071_169_004_05_18 in the main , is from the nature of things liable in particular in=
071_169_004_05_19 : stances to fail : especially as the Jury , in order to do their parts in

071_169_004_05_21 : late their oaths of Office and thereby incur the guilt of a kind of

116_300_002_02_06 The French nation , and the whole civilized world in
116_300_002_02_07 sympathy with it , cried shame upon the monster with five
116_300_002_02_08 heads ! What will it now say of the single head , that orga-
116_300_002_02_09 -nized this tenfold tyranny ? _
116_300_002_02_10 Such is the crime a sample at least of the crimes _
116_300_002_02_11 of William Pitt . His successors , not daring to be innocent
116_300_002_02_12 where he is guilty , choose rather to be accomplices than
116_300_002_02_13 avengers , or so much as disapprovers of his misdeeds . And
116_300_002_02_14 this conspiracy of present power with ill-earned influence for
116_300_002_02_15 of
116_300_002_02_16 the distruction law and justice _ this audacity _ the offspring
116_300_002_02_17 of pusillammity covers itself with the mask of respect and
116_300_002_02_18 gratitude . _
116_300_002_02_19 But would you then have had these living nuisances
116_300_002_02_20 turned loose again to prey upon the community _ upon a
116_300_002_02_21 community from which they had so justly and so necessarily
116_300_002_02_22 been expelled ? _ Corrupted , as you yourself alledge _ corrupted
116_300_002_02_23 as they have been by the very discipline which should
116_300_002_02_24 have reformed them _ would you have the Country receive
116_300_002_02_25 a second time all poison into her bosom ? _ After all
116_300_002_02_26 this outcry about illegality , and perfidy and oppression - is
116_300_002_02_27 thenis then after all the real aim and practical conclusion
116_300_002_02_28 at the bottom of it ? _
116_300_002_02_29 My Lord the difficulty cannot stand more fully
116_300_002_02_30 expressed in any eye than it does in mine . To mine , it is

116_303_002_02_01 In this dramatic age might not the recrimination scene
116_303_002_02_02 in Telemachus be re-exhibited in the Island of New South Wales ,
116_303_002_02_03 between this man of all-work and his guardian superior in
116_303_002_02_04 office and in eloquence ? _ got up as near as may be as it was
116_303_002_02_05 at the first acting in the desolate island its prototype when
116_303_002_02_06 performed by the discarded Ministers of the good Idomeneus ?
116_303_002_02_07 exhibited and with like satisfaction as well as instruction to the
116_303_002_02_08 lovers of practical as well as poetic justice ? _
116_303_002_02_09 No my Lord : the improved and ever alike improving
116_303_002_02_10 Colony , would not be quite so useless as it is if a pair of Right
116_303_002_02_11 Honourable Scholars , so well read in the red book of power , were
116_303_002_02_12 exported to it , and , with the black letter book of experience
116_303_002_02_13 upon their backs , sent there to learn as well as to teach a lesson
116_303_002_02_14 which hitherto they have been so much more engaged in teaching
116_303_002_02_15 than in learning _ the nature , use , and value of justice . _
116_303_002_02_16 But why ( I hear Your Lordship say ) all these idle allusions ?
116_303_002_02_17 romance in so grave and practical a subject ! fiction _ and that
116_303_002_02_18 not legal fiction _ in an argument on a question of law ! _
116_303_002_02_19 My Lord , there are uses in fiction : acknowledged uses : _
116_303_002_02_20 and one of them is to pave the way for the reception of important
116_303_002_02_21 truths . Does the fiction _ does the feigned punishment go too
116_303_002_02_22 far ? _ the truth , my Lord ? _ the real , the legal , the impending
116_303_002_02_23 punishment goes beyond it . _
116_303_002_02_24 A still severer fate awaits them : Yes , my Lord and
116_303_002_02_25 their associates too , in many a lofty station , unless Parliament in
116_303_002_02_26 its wisdom , should vouchsafe to shew mercy to those who have
116_303_002_02_27 shewn none . I say Parliament : for the mercy of even the King
116_303_002_02_28 himself would here be as impotent , to save the men by whom
116_303_002_02_29 his power has been thus abused , as his justice was to save from
116_303_002_02_30 their tyranny the multitudes who have been sacrificed to it . _

116_133_001_02_04 p206 We have also given powers to the said governors , with
116_133_001_02_05 the consent of our said councils , and the representatives of
116_133_001_02_06 the people , to be summoned as aforesaid , to make , constitute
116_133_001_02_07 and ordain laws , statutes , and ordinances , for the public
116_133_001_02_08 peace , welfare , and good government of our said colonies and
116_133_001_02_09 the inhabitants thereof , as near as may be agreeable to
116_133_001_02_10 the laws of England , and under such regulations and
116_133_001_02_11 restrictions , as are used in our other colonies .
116_133_001_02_12 p . 208 . A great deal has been said , and many authorities
116_133_001_02_13 cited relative to propositions , in which both sides seem to be
116_133_001_02_14 perfectly agreed ; and which indeed are too clear to be
116_133_001_02_15 controverted . The stating some of those propositions which
116_133_001_02_16 we think quite clear , will lead us to see with greater
116_133_001_02_17 perspicuity , what is the question upon the first point ,
116_133_001_02_18 and upon what hinge it turns . I will state the propositions
116_133_001_02_19 at large .
116_133_001_02_20 p . 208 The 4th , That the law and legislative government of
116_133_001_02_21 every dominion , equally affects all persons and all property
116_133_001_02_22 within the limits thereof ; and is the rule of decision for
116_133_001_02_23 all questions which arise there . Whoever purchases , lives ,
116_133_001_02_24 or ones there , puts himself under the law of the place .
116_133_001_02_25 An Englishman in Ireland , Minorca , the Isle of Man , or the
116_133_001_02_26 Plantations , has no privilege distinct from the natives .
116_133_001_02_27 p 209 . The 6th , and last proposition is , that if the kings ,
116_133_001_02_28 ( and when I say the king , I always mean the king , without
116_133_001_02_29 the concurrence of parliament ) has a power to alter the old
116_133_001_02_30 and to introduce new laws in a conquered country , this
116_133_001_02_31 legislation being subordinate , that is , subordinate to his
116_133_001_02_32 own authority in parliament , he cannot make any new
116_133_001_02_33 change contrary to fundamental principles : he cannot
116_133_001_02_34 exempt an inhabitant from that particular dominion ;
116_133_001_02_35 as for instance , from the laws of trade , or from the
116_133_001_02_36 power of parliament , or give him privileges exclusive
116_133_001_02_37 of his other subjects ; and so in many other instances
116_133_001_02_38 which might be put . _

071_035_003_04_01 r
071_035_003_04_02 The value of a new service occur ing in an old office is to be
071_035_003_04_03 estimated from its similarity to the old services . As the fee
071_035_003_04_04 which is annext to that one of the old services which comes nearest
071_035_003_04_05 to the new one is to the service it belongs to , so let the fee for the
071_035_003_04_06 new service be to such new services .
071_035_003_04_07 To p .
071_035_003_05_01 The Fees for offices and all services incident to these offices
071_035_003_05_02 ought every where to be adjusted by the legislator . Where this
071_035_003_05_03 is not done the extortion is not more to be imputed to the ra=
071_035_003_05_04 =pacity of the officer than to the negligence of the Legislator .
071_035_003_05_05 In as far as a Legislator authorizes an officer to take
071_035_003_05_06 more money for his service than it is worth , or makes more
071_035_003_05_07 such services necessary ( to the validity of a transaction ) than
071_035_003_05_08 the end requires he lays on a Tax .
071_035_003_06_01 An officer is to be deemed to have given the party
071_035_003_06_02 to understand that he will not do the service unless the
071_035_003_06_03 fee be given him if he do but demand it .
071_035_003_06_04 So if he do but accept it when offered
071_035_003_07_01 Where there is no service to be done for the fee , or where
071_035_003_07_02 the service is already performed and the party injured is

072_050_001_03_01 Offences against the external Security of the State .
072_050_001_04_01 Now let us consider the case where the party in :
072_050_001_04_02 : jured is a privileged member of a state in amity . For
072_050_001_04_03 the sake of the intercourse carried on between one state
072_050_001_04_04 and another when at amity it has been the custom to
072_050_001_04_05 invest those by whose means it is carried on , with par=
072_050_001_04_06 : ticular distinctions . Such persons are known by diffe=
072_050_001_04_07 : rent names according to their different ranks : but they
072_050_001_04_08 are also known all together by the common appellation
072_050_001_04_09 of Foreign Ministers . Were a person permitted to do an
072_050_001_04_10 injury to these great officers at no higher a price than
072_050_001_04_11 it would cost him to do the like injury to an ordinary
072_050_001_04_12 person , it is evident enough that on various occasions
072_050_001_04_13 the interests of both states might suffer in a very high
072_050_001_04_14 degree by the interruption which such outrages might
072_050_001_04_15 occasion in the management of their concerns . Even
072_050_001_04_16 in cases where no material interruption might ensue
072_050_001_04_17 to such concerns , the pride as well of sovereigns whose
072_050_001_04_18 persons these Officers are understood in a manner to
072_050_001_04_19 represent , as of the Officers themselves is apt to be suf=
072_050_001_04_20 : ficiently sensible to the outrage ; and it is the resent=
072_050_001_04_21 : ment which is thence apt to be entertained that con=

072_050_002_03_01 Offences against the external Security of the State .
072_050_002_04_01 constitutes perhaps the most immediate and universal
072_050_002_04_02 reason for giving an extraordinary degree of protection
072_050_002_04_03 to these privileged foreigners against all injuries what=
072_050_002_04_04 : soever .
072_050_002_04_05 To appease that resentment , an obvious expedient
072_050_002_04_06 is to deliver up to the Sovereign of the injured State all
072_050_002_04_07 have been
072_050_002_04_08 persons whatsoever who were concerned in the injury of=
072_050_002_04_09 : fered to his representative . Such an expedient can
072_050_002_04_10 scarcely fail of being effectual in any case ; and though
072_050_002_04_11 in most cases it may not be necessary , yet as there
072_050_002_04_12 may be cases in which nothing less will serve , it is fit
072_050_002_04_13 that a power should be given to the judicial Magistrate
072_050_002_04_14 to put it in practice if ever the Security of the State
072_050_002_04_15 should call for such a sacrifice .
072_050_002_04_16 The same power should for the like reasons be reserv=

073_071_001_03_15 be found on a closer Inspection not to do so _
073_071_001_03_16 Sensible of the Difficulty and Delicacy of the Task ,
073_071_001_03_17 I dare not promise , that such as I have respectively

073_071_001_03_19 for a certainty , in no Instance , of the Number .

096_002_003_02_02 understanding .
096_002_003_02_03 Our Author seems to have been led into this
096_002_003_02_04 inaccurate use of the term law , by a servile
096_002_003_02_05 imitation of Montesquieu . Montesquieu
096_002_003_02_06 had said before him , " Tous les êtres ont leurs
096_002_003_02_07 " loix , la divinitè a ses loix , le monde mate=
096_002_003_02_08 " riel a ses loix , les intelligences superieures
096_002_003_02_09 " à l ' homme ont leurs loix , les bêtes ont leurs
096_002_003_02_10 " loix , l ' homme a ses loix . " But then
096_002_003_02_11 Montesquieu had given a different diff
096_002_003_02_12 definition of law : he had said , " les loix sont les
096_002_003_02_13 " rapports , qui derivent de la nature des choses . "
096_002_003_02_14 and , supposing this definition to be just ,
096_002_003_02_15 his
096_002_003_02_16 supposing it not to have mistaken the
096_002_003_02_17 foundation of Law , for Law itself , then

071_184_002_04_02 Reasons
071_184_002_04_03 The mischief that can be done in this way by one offend=
071_184_002_04_04 : er or even a confederacy of offenders is not so great as at first sight
071_184_002_04_05 it might appear . By himself a man of a given rank of life for=
071_184_002_04_06 : tune and occupation cannot , without being detected , circulate
071_184_002_04_07 more Coin that it will be expected should be disbursed by a
071_184_002_04_08 as his appears to be
071_184_002_04_09 man of such rank , fortune , and reputation : and , of the Coin which
071_184_002_04_10 he does circulate , certainly it is not the whole that can be bad
071_184_002_04_11 Coin of his own coining . What he can circulate of this bad
071_184_002_04_12 Coin without being detected , will even bear but a small
071_184_002_04_13 ratio to the whole of the coin he circulates . It is true , that
071_184_002_04_14 by continually changing the people with whom he deals , and
071_184_002_04_15 thus contriving always to have strangers to deal with , he may
071_184_002_04_16 circulate more and more : but the circulation even when this
071_184_002_04_17 method is taken to extend it , has still its bounds . In the
071_184_002_04_18 first place the being perpetually employed in finding out new
071_184_002_04_19 persons to deal with will take up a considerable degree
071_184_002_04_20 of time . In the next place he must , upon an average , expend
071_184_002_04_21 with

071_184_003_04_01 with each of those persons a greater quantity of good Coin in
071_184_003_04_02 order to cover a smaller quantity of his own bad Coin .
071_184_003_04_03 The time which it will necessarily take him up
071_184_003_04_04 to find fit persons to deal with will be so much time taken
071_184_003_04_05 from his lawful occupation : nor can a man carry on the frau=
071_184_003_04_06 : dulent occupation in question without such a kind of ingenuity
071_184_003_04_07 derived from some lawful occupation he has been tieed up
071_184_003_04_08 in , as will naturally expose him in some degree to suspi=
071_184_003_04_09 : cion . If a manufacturer of metal buttons for instance gives
071_184_003_04_10 three or four shillings or three or four half pence in change
071_184_003_04_11 together that appear to be of the same die this circumstance
071_184_003_04_12 may of itself be sufficient to fix a considerable degree of
071_184_003_04_13 suspicion on a person of such an occupation . He can sel=
071_184_003_04_14 : dom therefore venture to put off many such pieces together .
071_184_003_04_15 If he procures many different moulds or stamps this will
071_184_003_04_16 in proportion take up more expence and time . Bad money
071_184_003_04_17 is in general more liable to suspicion the fresher it is ; for
071_184_003_04_18 the fresher they both are , the more easy it is to discover
071_184_003_04_19 those minute differences by which bad Coin is distinguishable
071_184_003_04_20 from
116_393_003_01_01 There remains the relieving my character from the official imputations already
116_393_003_01_02 complained of : but , if the above restitutio in integrum be performed , the imputations drop of course .
116_393_003_01_03 In a letter , which can hardly be a secret to you , I mentioned Mr Nepean
116_393_003_01_04 as a Gentleman who knows the whole of the business from the commencement
116_393_003_01_05 of it to the last stage : who knows a great deal about it that by considerations of
116_393_003_01_06 delicacy and propriety he has been restrained from communicating to me , but
116_393_003_01_07 who to you ( I am satisfied ) would communicate every thing that could be of use .
116_393_003_01_08 If , from any cause , it should have happened that you have not yet
116_393_003_01_09 turned the matter in your thoughts , you will , at any rate , I flatter myself ,
116_393_003_01_10 have the goodness to say something to me by which my expectations in regard
116_393_003_01_11 to time may in some measure be directed . _ I have the honour to be &c _

116_393_003_03_03 Dear Sir Blackheath 10 Septr . 1801 _
116_393_003_03_04 I must apologize for my inattention in neglecting to acknowledge
116_393_003_03_05 the receipt of your large packet respecting ... . I cannot however accuse
116_393_003_03_06 myself of having misused , an interval of leisure ; for , Mr H . A . having
116_393_003_03_07 been absent till within these two days , I have had the whole routine of
116_393_003_03_08 office to attend to , which has nearly made up for the cessation of
116_393_003_03_09 Parliamentary business .
116_393_003_03_10 With respect to your Convict plan , I have not yet had an op-
116_393_003_03_11 -portunity of consulting with Lord Pelham , on whose decision the business
116_393_003_03_12 must principally turn . _

116_279_001_03_01 In conclusion , my Lord , I am inclined to think Your
116_279_001_03_02 Lordship will find the following charges , against the Duke
116_279_001_03_03 of Portland , but too well established . _
116_279_001_03_04 1 . That he has not only assumed , but concurred in the
116_279_001_03_05 exercise of , a dispensing power , by advancing positions tending
116_279_001_03_06 to warrant him in defeating _ and defeating accordingly _ the
116_279_001_03_07 the sole object of the Act of 1794 , by which a Penitentiary estab-
116_279_001_03_08 -lishment was required to be set on foot : and , in so doing ,
116_279_001_03_09 has been guilty of an illegal exercise of legislative power , a-
116_279_001_03_10 -mounting in its effects to the repeal of an imperative law
116_279_001_03_11 of Parliament .
116_279_001_03_12 has
116_279_001_03_13 2 . The he assumed and exercised the power of punish-
116_279_001_03_14 -ing Convicts , by a mode of punishment of his own choice ,
116_279_001_03_15 in cases in which that mode of punishment was , by Par-
116_279_001_03_16 -liament , expressly forbidden to be employed : and , in so doing ,
116_279_001_03_17 has been guilty of another illegal exercise of legislative power ,
116_279_001_03_18 amounting in its effects to the enactment of a positive impera-
116_279_001_03_19 -tive law , as well as to the repeal of a prohibitive law . _
116_279_001_03_20 3 . That , in another instance , he has assumed at any
116_279_001_03_21 rate ( whether in any and what degree he may have exercised
116_279_001_03_22 it , being matter of enquiry ) a dispensing power , viz : that of
116_279_001_03_23 defeating one of the declared objects of another Act _ the Act
116_279_001_03_24 of 1779 _ in so far as the confinement of Convicts of a certain
116_279_001_03_25 description on board the Hulks , is among the modes of pu-
116_279_001_03_26 -nishment , the choice of which is therein committed to the
116_279_001_03_27 respective Courts : and , in so doing , has been guilty of another
116_279_001_03_28 illegal exercise of legislative power , amounting in its effects to
116_279_001_03_29 the repeal of a corresponding portion of another imperative law . _

071_146_001_04_01 ( a )
071_146_001_04_02 Sharping or fraudulent obtainment is where
071_146_001_04_03 ( A )
071_146_001_04_04 a man , by false suggestions or deceitful behavi :

071_146_001_04_08 ( D )
071_146_001_04_09 : self is conscious , is concerned in obtaining money
071_146_001_04_10 or money ' s worth , intending not to be amenable
071_146_001_04_11 to Law .
071_146_001_04_12 Exposition
071_146_001_05_01 Note .
071_146_001_05_02 ( a ) The term Sharping is rather a low expression .
071_146_001_05_03 In general however it seems preferable to Fraudulent
071_146_001_05_04 obtainment , exhibiting the same idea by a single
071_146_001_05_05 word . Besides that Sharping has the conjugate Sharp=
071_146_001_05_06 : er to express the Agent : and the expression Frau=
071_146_001_05_07 : dulent obtainment has no such conjugate to answer
071_146_001_05_08 to
071_146_001_05_09 it . In point of signification the term filouterie in
071_146_001_05_10 French seems to answer to it exactly : the originati=
071_146_001_05_11 : on of the two words , though somewhat different ,
071_146_001_05_12 is still analogous . In both cases the immaterial
071_146_001_05_13 idea that is meant to be typified is that of
071_146_001_05_14 cunning . But the material image employed for
071_146_001_05_15 that purpose is in the English , that of sharpness ;
071_146_001_05_16 as in the words acuteness , and acumen : in the
071_146_001_05_17 it seems to be
071_146_001_05_18 French , that of slenderness ; as in the word finesse . Fi=
071_146_001_05_19 lou from Fil , a thread : fin comme un fil . As to the
071_146_001_05_20 word Defraudment , it is as yet but little if at all in use : nobody

072_054_003_03_03 foreign government gives you a pension , it certainly is not with=

072_054_003_03_09 in particular , so long as it is not known what the services are ,
072_054_003_03_10 cannot be understood . It is proper therefore that the pensioner should

072_054_003_03_12 be known ; and the assigned cause for which he receives this pen=

072_054_003_03_18 The Punishment for non-registering should be capable .
072_054_003_03_19 at least of being raised to a level with that of treason . For as

072_099_001_03_01 Theft Embezzlement and Fraudulent obtainment
072_099_001_04_01 If a man pawns the goods of another as if they were his
072_099_001_04_02 own this is one way of converting them to his own use
072_099_001_04_03 Observation,s
072_099_001_04_04 It may be thought that pawning another persons _
072_099_001_04_05 goods is not quite so mischievous an offence as ordinary
072_099_001_04_06 stealing And in truth the mischievous consequence of an
072_099_001_04_07 act of Theft is in some small degree deminished by the goods
072_099_001_04_08 being disposed of in this manner . If a man pawns the
072_099_001_04_09 goods instead of selling them out right it affords some
072_099_001_04_10 presumption of his intending to restore them : besides
072_099_001_04_11 that by being deposited with the pawnbroker they are
072_099_001_04_12 responsible
072_099_001_04_13 forthcoming in the hands of a respectable person and all
072_099_001_04_14 there is wanting is it , being discovered where they are
072_099_001_04_15 which by the attention and honesty of the pawn brokers
072_099_001_04_16 is what very often happens
072_099_001_04_17 But if the offender does really return the goods provi=
072_099_001_04_18 =sion is made by the general clause for the
072_099_001_04_19 of his punishment : and as it is strictly and indubitably

116_643_001_02_02 of the gentleman who does every thing _ was not to be
116_643_001_02_03 made up so easily : a hecatomb , and more than a
116_643_001_02_04 hecatomb , of victims was to be sacrificed , before an
116_643_001_02_05 offering could be raind worthy of the chosen priest ,
116_643_001_02_06 who was to stretch his hands over the altar , and
116_643_001_02_07 make as if he were putting a period to the sacrifice .

116_643_001_02_10 me : rumour _ notoriety _ whatsoever be the word _
116_643_001_02_11 is in several points the only ground I can exhi-
116_643_001_02_12 -bit even so much as in the way of reference .
116_643_001_02_13 I have no eye-witness to depose , that as often as
116_643_001_02_14 a Noble Secretary hias appeared to act , a gentleman
116_643_001_02_15 on the other side the wainscoat has pulled the wirer .

116_643_001_02_17 the
116_643_001_02_18 of his pocket , and the gentlemen out of whose
116_643_001_02_19 pocket the other popped , is a point not less diffi-
116_643_001_02_20 -cult to prove , at least by the evidence of sense .
116_643_001_02_21 The Nobel Lord and the gentleman on the other
116_643_001_02_22 side of the wainscoat could , either of them , by their
116_643_001_02_23 evidence put both points out of doubt . Fortunately
116_643_001_02_24 or unfortunately the favourite ma maxim about
116_643_001_02_25 self-crimination and self-depredation , the maxim
116_643_001_02_26 made to cow cowe cover this and every thing else
116_643_001_02_27 that oughr ought to be disclosed , steps in & covers
116_643_001_02_28 them : so that on this occasion , as on all others ,

071_180_003_05_14 may in that case be very proper to employ punishment to deter

096_051_001_02_02 " comprehensive venue , signifies a rule of action ; and is applied
096_051_001_02_03 " indiscriminately to all kinds of action , whether animate or
096_051_001_02_04 " inanimate , rational or irrational . Thus we say the Laws of-
096_051_001_02_05 " motion , of gravitation , of optics , of mechanics , as well as the Laws
096_051_001_02_06 " of nature and of nations . And it is that rule of action , which

096_051_001_02_11 NOTE
096_051_001_02_12 for a definition of it . When a man is at the pains of giving us the
096_051_001_02_13 sense of word in a definition , what one expects is that he should
096_051_001_02_14 abide by it : that it should be always his sense at least whosoever
096_051_001_02_15 else it be : that in that sense he should always use the word , &
096_051_001_02_16 and in that only . If after pretending thus to fix it he lets it _
096_051_001_02_17 slip from him , and another slide into its place ; how is it that his

115_087_002_02_21 Art . 22 . And Whereas by a Report made to the
115_087_002_02_22 Honourable the House of Commons by a Committee of the
115_087_002_02_23 said House , and dated the twenty second day of March 1784
115_087_002_02_24 it appears that according to the first estimates made by
115_087_002_02_25 Mess : rs Blackburn and Hardwick Architects of the expence
115_087_002_02_26 of erecting Penitentiary Houses fit for the reception of 900
115_087_002_02_27 Prisoners according to the plan prescribed by the Statute
115_087_002_02_28 of the 19th of his Majesty Chapter 74 , the same would
115_087_002_02_29 have
096_052_001_01_01 Law in General . ( 5
096_052_001_02_01 for the Law giver is somewhat curious : Beside man , the following
096_052_001_02_02 are the set of " inferiors " he has given him already to talk to write or _
096_052_001_02_03 to make signs to : He has given him in the first place all sorts of _
096_052_001_02_04 things that are moveable , gravitating , visible , and susceptible of me-
096_052_001_02_05 [ as we have seen already )
096_052_001_02_06 -chanisim : and in particular ( as we shall see presently ] amongst the
096_052_001_02_07 rest all animals and vegetables by name . This being the case with
096_052_001_02_08 the word [ " prescribed " ] and [ " dictated " ] the best that can be said of them
096_052_001_02_09 and it was this no-meaning
096_052_001_02_10 is that they have no meaning ; that our Author seems to have depended
096_052_001_02_11 on to save them from being seen to have a false one . That Clocks _
096_052_001_02_12 have Laws prescribed or dictated to them : is a proposition , which
096_052_001_02_13 without sense
096_052_001_02_14 so long as men content themselves with sounds , may pass for true :
096_052_001_02_15 but so soon as any precise import is given to these words , must be
096_052_001_02_16 seen plainly to be false .
096_052_001_02_17 What is said of Law in general , we naturally expect to find agree _
096_052_001_02_18 with each sort of Law in particular : For what agrees with the Genus
096_052_001_02_19 No
096_052_001_02_20 agrees with every Species . There is not a Rule of Logic better known
096_052_001_02_21 truth
096_052_001_02_22 and untutored common sense bears testimony to the justice of it .
096_052_001_02_23 For it is but a declaration of the sense that all mankind who care

071_157_002_04_10 to the offence than to the offender . Where the Offence is such
071_157_002_04_11 as is seldom committed but by persons too poor to be in

071_157_002_04_13 where it is such as persons in responsible circumstances

071_053_004_03_10 powerfully a man is acted upon in direction by other
071_053_004_03_11 powers with the less force is it necessary to act upon
071_053_004_03_12 him in the way of punishment
071_053_004_03_13 4 : But the most forcible objection of all seems to be
071_053_004_03_14 that if an extraodinary punishment were appointed in
071_053_004_03_15 this case the greater it were the less likely it would
071_053_004_03_16 be to be put in execution from whence it would become

116_617_001_03_02 ability , though devoted exclusively to the service ,
116_617_001_03_03 to bring the improved English prisons in question
116_617_001_03_04 upon a level in point of economy with that of
116_617_001_03_05 Philadelphia . It is not without surprize that
116_617_001_03_06 in some instances within my reach Dorsetshire
116_617_001_03_07 in particular ( Oxfordshire I have but an indistinct
116_617_001_03_08 recollection of ) I have observed in how meritorious
116_617_001_03_09 ( c )
116_617_001_03_10 a degree these obstacles have been overcome .
116_617_001_03_11 In these home instances the grand misfortune
116_617_001_03_12 is , that in regard to the main object _ the object
116_617_001_03_13 with reference to which example and reformation
116_617_001_03_14 themselves are but as means to an end _ I mean
116_617_001_03_15 the decreased of crimes _ circumstances do not
116_617_001_03_16 admit of their affording any such satisfactory proofs
116_617_001_03_17 of efficacy as in the more favourable situation of
116_617_001_03_18 the Philadelphia prison may be and have been
116_617_001_03_19 afforded : _ why ? _ because the good effects of the
116_617_001_03_20 discipline of these good jails are to such a degree
116_617_001_03_21 drowned in the bad effects of the surrounding bad
116_617_001_03_22 ones . * In Pensylvanyia too & in New York , the whole
116_617_001_03_23 system of penal justice is invigorated by the abolition
116_617_001_03_24 of capital punishment as above : while in England
116_617_001_03_25 the debility resulting from the opposite excess ( by
116_617_001_03_26 debility I mean the relaxation that pervades the
116_617_001_03_27 whole system of procedure ) is such as cannot be
116_617_001_03_28 compensated in any ascertainable degree by the
116_617_001_03_29 utmost efficacy of such local & partial improvements .

072_054_001_04_01 The title of Offences against the National Interest in
072_054_001_04_02 general may serve to include all such acts of which it is supposed that
072_054_001_04_03 they may prove prejudicial in one or more of the several ways in which
072_054_001_04_04 an act can be prejudicial to the community , but without its appear :

072_054_001_04_09 It may serve as a miscellaneous title under which may
072_054_001_04_10 be ranked any offences which cannot properly be ranked under any
072_054_001_04_11 single one of any of the preceding classes .
072_054_001_04_12 From what has been seen already of the nature of this
072_054_001_04_13 Class it is plain that the contents of it cannot be arranged in any
072_054_001_04_14 exhaustive method like those of the other classes . The offences that ap :
072_054_001_04_15 pear to belong to it must be picked up here and there as they occur .

073_055_001_03_01 The Definition I am about to give , indicative of
073_055_001_03_02 the Nature of the Act , is commensurate to the Term ,
073_055_001_03_03 expressive of the moral Idea , Theft .
073_055_001_03_04 DEFINITION
073_055_001_03_05 Theft then may be defined , The taking of a
073_055_001_03_06 moveable thing , by one conscious of his not having
073_055_001_03_07 any Title so to do , and without the Consent of any
073_055_001_03_08 one who has , in the Intention of making it his own .
073_055_001_03_09 Distinguishable from this in it ' s Conception , though
073_055_001_03_10 actually distinguished from it by the Law , in some
073_055_001_03_11 Instances only , whilst in others it is confounded with
073_055_001_03_12 it , is the Offence of Embezzlement .
073_055_001_03_13 Embezzlement is where a Man having
073_055_001_03_14 taken , on having Liberty to take a moveable Thing , by
073_055_001_03_15 the Consent of the Owner expressed or to be implied ,
073_055_001_03_16 if not obtained by Fraud , does some Act with the
073_055_001_03_17 Intention of making it his own in the consciousness of
073_055_001_03_18 having no Title so to do .
073_055_001_03_19 Having for a Moment introduced the Mention of
073_055_001_03_20 this Offence here , for the sake of narrowing the Notion of
073_055_001_03_21 Theft on all sides to it ' s proper Point , I shall dismiss the
073_055_001_03_22 further
116_301_002_01_01 32
116_301_002_02_01 confinement any where in England two things require here
116_301_002_02_02 to be observed - 1st That it would be no more than the
116_301_002_02_03 fulfillment of promises already made : 2nd That being but
116_301_002_02_04 being a compliance with the respective laws it is no more
116_301_002_02_05 than what used to take place under the do transportation
116_301_002_02_06 system- no more than would have taken place had
116_301_002_02_07 there never been any such Colony as New South Wales .
116_301_002_02_08 Notwithstanding this , there is , it must be confessed , in the
116_301_002_02_09 idea of such influx of something that can scarce fail
116_301_002_02_10 terror
116_301_002_02_11 to strike a sort of horror into every breast that thinks of it .
116_301_002_02_12 This terror , so far as it is inspired by reason
116_301_002_02_13 and reflection , has two main grounds , which distinguish
116_301_002_02_14 the exigency in question from former times . Under the origi-
116_301_002_02_15 -nal transportation system , a great part were reformed ( I
116_301_002_02_16 have stated elsewhere by what causes ) of whom again a
116_301_002_02_17 great part , perhaps the greatest part , staid abroad : and ,
116_301_002_02_18 whether reformed or not , those who did return dropped in
116_301_002_02_19 gradually , and in small numbers , as their terms expired .
116_301_002_02_20 Under Mr Pitt ' s system , they have been almost without
116_301_002_02_21 exception , worse corrupted than before : and , where the
116_301_002_02_22 unbending rules of strict justice to be obeyed , the accumulated
116_301_002_02_23 corruption of so many years would come pouring into the
116_301_002_02_24 country all at once _
116_301_002_02_25 Such being the knot , what course can be taken , for
116_301_002_02_26 the untying , or even the cutting it ? _
116_301_002_02_27 Expedients certainly have occurred to me , by which a
116_301_002_02_28 a middle course might be pursued , and the sum total of
116_301_002_02_29 evil lessened : but , in the present state of things , the labour
116_301_002_02_30 of defending , or stating , or even an arguing and maturing them ,
116_301_002_02_31 would

072_066_003_04_01 be by the establishing of some pubic works , in which
072_066_003_04_02 chooses ,
072_066_003_04_03 any one who chooses it may , for as long as he lives
072_066_003_04_04 be permitted to take a part . The general nature of
072_066_003_04_05 such works will be considered in another place .

072_066_003_04_09 : ever idleness and whatever indigence there may be , is
072_066_003_04_10 the fault not of the subject but of the Legislator . When
072_066_003_04_11 it is provided , if it be only for want of being able
072_066_003_04_12 to get work that a man continues without employment ,
072_066_003_04_13 he will be glad to go there , and get it : if it be from
072_066_003_04_14 an aversion to working , it is very fit that he should
072_066_003_04_15 leads
072_066_003_04_16 be made to go there . Such aversion being a disposition that
072_066_003_04_17 him as we have seen , into all sorts of offences , it is very
072_066_003_04_18 suffer for it . Now to make him suffer for it in the
072_066_003_04_19 fittest manner in which he can be made to suffer
072_066_003_04_20 there needs no more than to compel him to take
072_066_003_04_21 the benefit of such an institution ; compulsion for
072_066_003_04_22 the future will answer every purpose of punish=
072_066_003_04_23 : ment for the past .
072_066_003_04_24 The expence of such establishments is an
072_066_003_04_25 inconvenience

116_279_002_03_01 4 . That at any rate on the part of his Under Secretary ,
116_279_002_03_02 Mr King , by whom the letter , containing the manifestation of
116_279_002_03_03 these several illegal pretensions was drawn up , the offence
116_279_002_03_04 was _ not in any degree the result of a bona fide miscon-
116_279_002_03_05 -ception or inadvertence _ but , wilful , deliberate , and obstinate : _
116_279_002_03_06 the repugnance , between the intentions , as declared in such
116_279_002_03_07 letter , and the will of Parliament , as declared in the Acts ,
116_279_002_03_08 on which those intentions were pretended to be grounded _ being
116_279_002_03_09 a circumstance , of which , from the first to the last , he Mr
116_279_002_03_10 King was fully conscious : and that this criminal conscious-
116_279_002_03_11 -ness is , prima facie at least , to be imputed to the Duke _ the
116_279_002_03_12 Principal Secretary _ by whom the letter was signed ; in as
116_279_002_03_13 much as , in that letter , he declares in express terms that he
116_279_002_03_14 has " examined " the said Acts _ and that he " understands the
116_279_002_03_15 " object of " them . _
116_279_002_03_16 That besides these offences against the authority of

116_279_002_03_18 Treasury and their Secretaries in giving to the party con-
116_279_002_03_19 -tracting with the Treasury , by a letter written after many
116_279_002_03_20 months deliberation and conference , an authority for making
116_279_002_03_21 preparations for an establishment of double the magnitude ,
116_279_002_03_22 and consequently double the expence , of that which , by the ac-
116_279_002_03_23 -ceptance of the original proposal , they stood engaged to give ; _
116_279_002_03_24 _ such authority being given in the express view , of making

071_168_004_05_03 good deal aided by the difficulty or rather impossibility of meeting
071_168_004_05_04 any where with a sufficient quantity of genuine .
071_168_004_05_05 In both these instances indeed , it may be said that gener=

071_168_004_05_07 nothing more than bare suspicion . There is however very fre=

071_168_004_05_10 knowledge imports is that the matter of fact is true , or that
071_168_004_05_11 the party who is said to know it is persuaded of its being so ,
071_168_004_05_12 there is often as much knowledge in this case as there can be
071_168_004_05_13 in any . If the meaning was that the circumstance of know=

071_168_004_05_15 proved by some additional collateral evidence it were worth
071_168_004_05_16 while surely to have said so . To denounce a punishment
071_168_004_05_17 when there is evidently no chance of its being executed can
071_168_004_05_18 serve only to bring the Law into contempt .

116_070_001_02_01 P . 92 . February 1796 . " A general muster took place on the
116_070_001_02_02 " 14th in every district of the colony , at which every labouring
116_070_001_02_03 " man , whether free or conict convict , was obliged to appear . on the
116_070_001_02_04 " following morning the settlers were called over , previous to which ,
116_070_001_02_05 " the governor , who was present , informed them , that he had
116_070_001_02_06 " heard of much discontent prevailing among them in consequence
116_070_001_02_07 " of certain heavy grievances which they said they laboured under . For
116_070_001_02_08 " then , as he was unacquainted with the nature of them , he was
116_070_001_02_09 " unable to suggest any remedy , he therefore desure desired that
116_070_001_02_10 " they might be represented to him in writing ; and , to spare
116_070_001_02_11 " them as much trouble as possible , he would direct two gentle-
116_070_001_02_12 - " men on whom he had much dependance to visit the different
116_070_001_02_13 " districts , and collect from the respective settlers such of their
116_070_001_02_14 " distresses and grievances as they were desier desire desirous of
116_070_001_02_15 " making known . Before they were dismissed , he gave them much
116_070_001_02_16 " good advice ; and assured them , that he had already , from his
116_070_001_02_17 " own ideas , offered a plan to the secretary of state for their
116_070_001_02_18 " benefit , which he hoped in due time would be attended to _
116_070_001_02_19 " After then , the women and children were mustered , and
116_070_001_02_20 " were found to compose a very considerable part of the settlement . "

073_053_001_03_02 different grammatical Modification _ the two first
073_053_001_03_03 being used where a Verb or a Participle , the latter
073_053_001_03_04 where a Substantive is required .
073_053_001_03_05 The Use of the Word Theft is governed by the
073_053_001_03_06 Nature of the Act ; and ' tis from thence as we shall
073_053_001_03_07 soon see that it takes it ' s Definition .
073_053_001_03_08 The Word Larceny has its Import coextensive only
073_053_001_03_09 the
073_053_001_03_10 with Punishment annexed by the peculiar Jurisprudence
073_053_001_03_11 of our own Country to the main Body of the other
073_053_001_03_12 Title : applying in it ' s proper Signification to such
073_053_001_03_13 Cases only of Theft as are punished with the Punishment
073_053_001_03_14 called Felony .
073_053_001_03_15 With Regard to this Definition , the Source of
073_053_001_03_16 which will be hereafter explained , it is sufficient at
073_053_001_03_17 present to observe , that it is not taken from any Difference
073_053_001_03_18 in the Nature of the Act : so that if when therefore we
073_053_001_03_19 meet with any Passage in a practical Book which intimates
073_053_001_03_20 , that of such & such a Subject Larceny cannot be committed ,
073_053_001_03_21 it
073_053_001_03_22 we are not to conceive that the Act of Stealing is deficient
073_053_001_03_23 in any of those Qualities which if it had been committed
073_053_001_03_24 on certain other Subjects would have denominated it

071_140_001_04_04 : though in the most obvious sense of the phrase
071_140_001_04_05 he cannot be said absolutely to intend not to
071_140_001_04_06 be amenable to law yet it is but imperfectly
071_140_001_04_07 that he intends to be amenable . He intends
071_140_001_04_08 not in any event so to be amenable as to
071_140_001_04_09 render You compleat Justice . When You have
071_140_001_04_10 received all the Compensation which the Law
071_140_001_04_11 ( without a provision of this sort ) can render You ,
071_140_001_04_12 you will still remain as to the greater part
071_140_001_04_13 of your loss in as bad a situation as if You
071_140_001_04_14 had suffered from a Theft . You will in fact
071_140_001_04_15 be in a much worse situation . For when You
071_140_001_04_16 have lost a thing by a theft , you will still
071_140_001_04_17 have the chance of detecting and punishing
071_140_001_04_18 such

073_072_001_03_02 review of the Definitions given by expository Writers ,
073_072_001_03_03 and to observe with what success they have illustrated
073_072_001_03_04 a favourite Aphorism of their own , that to

073_072_001_03_06 Larceny , ( for that we may remember is
073_072_001_03_07 the Term employed by them ) is defined by the

073_072_001_03_14 it is altogether as edifying and instructive
073_072_001_03_15 for the Purpose of characterizing the Offence
073_072_001_03_16 as the word " Cabalistical " or any other
073_072_001_03_17 uncouth Word that might be substituted

116_288_001_03_02 been thus perverted into an instrument of iniquity - a tool
116_288_001_03_03 of dispensing power . The mask was now thrown off and the
116_288_001_03_04 Monster presented itself in undisguised deformity . I mean that face
116_288_001_03_05 of it which was seen where the power was felt - in New South Wales :
116_288_001_03_06 for the face seen in this Country was never completely unmatted
116_288_001_03_07 till now . Not only had this most obvious precaution been neglected ,
116_288_001_03_08 but at this time , no instructions whatever for the Governor , in any
116_288_001_03_09 such view as that of preventing the return of Convicts - at least
116_288_001_03_10 of de jure emancipated Convicts - had been received . For at this
116_288_001_03_11 very time ( as we learn from the paragraph next before the
116_288_001_03_12 above ) such as should be desirous of returning to England were
116_288_001_03_13 " informed , that no obstacle would be shown in their way " ( the
116_288_001_03_14 way of those Convicts whose sentences of transportation had expired +
116_288_001_03_15 " they being at liberty to ship themselves on board of such vessels
116_288_001_03_16 " as would give them a passage " . - Such was the communication ,
116_288_001_03_17 -such the language , which justice would naturally dictate to
116_288_001_03_18 honourable minds ; unfettered as yet and uncorrupted , by instruct
116_288_001_03_19 ions as oppressive and perfidious as they were illegal .
116_288_001_03_20 Yet , it is after this , that among the ingredients in the
116_288_001_03_21 composition of the " utility " of this " settlement " the " circumstances of
116_288_001_03_22 " its freeing the Mother Country from the depraved branches of her
116_288_001_03_23 " offspring " # is mentioned by its ci-devant Judge Advocate , and still
116_288_001_03_24 faithful though ever candid and honourable advocate , upon the
116_288_001_03_25 list . Whence then , it may be asked ; comes this language , and
116_288_001_03_26 under circumstances so little favourable to the use of it ? Whence ?
116_288_001_03_27 but that such ( as I have all along said ) was the design on both
116_288_001_03_28 floors of the Treasury and the design - the only ostensible one , being
116_288_001_03_29 of course no secret , such was the conversation on the subject ,

071_129_002_03_01 Of Semi-public Offences in General .
071_129_002_04_01 Of the calamities which a Neighbourhood may be exposed to , the
071_129_002_04_02 principal ones seem to be such as are derived from the sources follow=
071_129_002_04_03 =ing :
071_129_002_04_04 1 . Pestilence or Contagion .
071_129_002_04_05 2 . Famine and other kinds of Scarcity .
071_129_002_04_06 3 . Mischief by Infants , Idiots and Maniacs .
071_129_002_04_07 4 . Ravages of noxious Animals .
071_129_002_04_08 5 . Collapsion , i.e . the fall of Buildings or other large masses of
071_129_002_04_09 matter artificial or natural .
071_129_002_04_10 6 . Inundation or Submersion .
071_129_002_04_11 7 . Tempest .
071_129_002_04_12 8 . Blight
071_129_002_04_13 9 . Conflagration .
071_129_002_04_14 10 . Explosion .
071_129_002_04_15 In classing these calamities the division of crimes will not be of
071_129_002_04_16 any great use . It is obvious that they can none of them have any ef=

116_639_002_02_02 If in one of the two instances situation in life was
116_639_002_02_03 such as to exclude hope of acceptance , that could b
116_639_002_02_04 not be the case in the other .
116_639_002_02_05 Thirty years ago the indefatigable & gratuitous
116_639_002_02_06 Agent of the Charity for the relief of debtors , travelled
116_639_002_02_07 the first of circuits three years before even Howard
116_639_002_02_08 had begun his . I called Neild a second Howard :
116_639_002_02_09 with more propriety I called Howard a second Neild .
116_639_002_02_10 Howard sunk under a jail fever , Neild has survived
116_639_002_02_11 one . The exertrions of Howard have long since received
116_639_002_02_12 their quietus from above : Neilds seem but to in-
116_639_002_02_13 -crease with age . Two such circuits in one year
116_639_002_02_14 adorn the annals of 1802 . This Honourable Colleague
116_639_002_02_15 _ a Member of the legislature and not an idle one _
116_639_002_02_16 a man standing already in full light _ would derive
116_639_002_02_17 nothing like illustration from a hand like mine .
116_639_002_02_18 In a station like Your Lordships there have
116_639_002_02_19 been men that would have knelt to both these
116_639_002_02_20 gentlemen rather than not have gained one of them
116_639_002_02_21 for the office . In the instance of Mr Neild at
116_639_002_02_22 any rate , whether he would or would not have
116_639_002_02_23 accepted of the office would not be known , to a
116_639_002_02_24 certainty at least , without asking : accordingly he
116_639_002_02_25 was not asked . The experiment would have been
116_639_002_02_26 too dangerous : it was a case not to be trifled with .
116_639_002_02_27 Seeing how he had been occupying himself , and what
116_639_002_02_28 he lived for , would any prudent man have an
116_639_002_02_29 swered for his non-acceptance ? Yeer Year after

115_112_001_02_15 installments would then stand £12,000 amd £12,000 ,
115_112_001_02_16 instead of £10,000 and £10,000 : the last instalment
115_112_001_02_17 payable on the reception of the Prisoners to re-
115_112_001_02_18 -main as it is at £7000 . This £4000 being

116_291_002_02_01 I . Conduct of the Governor towards Expirees , principally in relation
116_291_002_02_02 to their liberty of departure , before the month of August 1792 : being
116_291_002_02_03 the time at which the intelligence was received , of the Instructions
116_291_002_02_04 subjecting it to his will and pleasure .
116_291_002_02_05 No . 1 ( p . 74 ) July 1789 . The situation in which Expirees in
116_291_002_02_06 general now found themselves placed has been already stated .
116_291_002_02_07 By one individual in particular , an experimental proof of the
116_291_002_02_08 nature of the situation was at this same time received . The
116_291_002_02_09 only evidence by which the Governor ' s right to confine any body
116_291_002_02_10 in New South Wales could be established not being forth-
116_291_002_02_11 -coming , a man in whose instance there was no doubt but
116_291_002_02_12 that his time of punishment was expired , claimed his liberty .
116_291_002_02_13 For the course of his argument , having used some words which
116_291_002_02_14 though not mentioned were deemed " disrespectful to the
116_291_002_02_15 " Lieutenant Governor " , he was punished with six hundred lashes ,
116_291_002_02_16 and kept in irons for six months . A very instructive example
116_291_002_02_17 certainly : it showed more what was to be got by talking about rights .
116_291_002_02_18 No . 2 ( p . 130 ) August 1790 . Another freeman trying to quit the
116_291_002_02_19 Colony punished " for taking a very improper mode " . The act itself
116_291_002_02_20 consisted in the exercise of that liberty which the law of the land
116_291_002_02_21 had saved to him , and which no man alive had any right so
116_291_002_02_22 much as to pretend to give him leave to exercise . The impropriety
116_291_002_02_23 of the mode consisted in the not asking leave , at the risk of
116_291_002_02_24 receiving six hundred lashes and wearing irons for six months .
116_291_002_02_25 Mode of punishment of course flogging though not mentioned :
116_291_002_02_26 number of lashes not mentioned . This freeman " was punished to-
116_291_002_02_27 - " gether with a Convict " ( bondsman ) who had made a like attempt
116_291_002_02_28 in the same ship at the same time . As far as can be judged ,
116_291_002_02_29 right or no right made no sort of difference .
116_291_002_02_30 No . 3 .
096_098_002_01_01 In fact there are few , if any , Laws but what are

071_202_001_04_09 some measure too those of peace . It is very fit the people
071_202_001_04_10 should have the means of making their sentiments known
071_202_001_04_11 as well to persons in authority as to each other ; and
071_202_001_04_12 that for the sake of persons in authority as well as
071_202_001_04_13 of people themselves . The most effectual as well as
071_202_001_04_14 the mildest way of preventing their doing it in an
071_202_001_04_15 outrageous , tumultuous and mischievous manner is
071_202_001_04_16 to permit them to do it in a peaceable manner . The
071_202_001_04_17 more pains have been taken by harsh Laws and a severe
071_202_001_04_18 administration to oblige the people to stifle their affections ,
071_202_001_04_19 break out

071_163_001_04_05 reducible to the following heads : viz

071_163_001_04_07 of which the object is to search out and punish as many as

071_163_001_04_17 Of the nature and scope of provisions against

071_159_003_04_01 only to be applied for the 3rd offence or in very gross cases
071_159_003_04_02 for the 2d . The reason of ( Giving ) the latitude that is
071_159_003_04_03 in point of duration to the
071_159_003_04_04 given to confinement to hard labour is that in cases _
071_159_003_04_05 where the profit of the cheat was trifling the quantity of this
071_159_003_04_06 punishment if no greater than what would be in proportion
071_159_003_04_07 to the profit of the offence upon the rate above established
071_159_003_04_08 would be so small as that to a man who had already been
071_159_003_04_09 familarized to it by experience it would scarcely be an
071_159_003_04_10 object . As to the ignominious punishment , the use of
071_159_003_04_11 applying it is not so much the effect it may be expected to
071_159_003_04_12 have upon those to whom it is designed to be applied some=

115_110_004_03_02 purpose he does not very well see how , in justice
115_110_004_03_03 to his Representatives , he could avoid calling upon
115_110_004_03_04 the persons in question to admit them or deny them
115_110_004_03_05 ( a troublesome and unpleasant business on both sides )
115_110_004_03_06 nor would it be a pleasant situation for him to
115_110_004_03_07 have to leave his Representatives with a burthen
115_110_004_03_08 of such a weight hanging over their heads .
115_110_004_03_09 Mr Ford will easily conceive , that the Building ,
115_110_004_03_10 though a considerable part , is nothing nigh the
115_110_004_03_11 whole of the expence at coming in . Fitting up &
115_110_004_03_12 furnishing , especially the apartments of the Officers ,
115_110_004_03_13 Clerks , &c , who will be very numerous , stocking the
115_110_004_03_14 Manufactories and the Hospital , Cloathing ( an article
115_110_004_03_15 which must come heavy at first before there are
115_110_004_03_16 old cloaths to serve for working ) All this , besides
115_110_004_03_17 a new invented system of machinery , which , though
115_110_004_03_18 not half compleated for such a number , has already
115_110_004_03_19 cost several thousand pounds . So far therefore from
115_110_004_03_20 having been understood that the £15,000 was all of it
115_110_004_03_21 for the building , it is not true , nor any thing like
115_110_004_03_22 true . Mr Campbel ' s charge , as appears from the
115_110_004_03_23 Reports of the House of Commons , was at the
115_110_004_03_24 rate of £30,000 instead of the £27,000 and that
115_110_004_03_25 for several years together .

072_168_001_04_11 him , rolling him in the kennel . There are an infinity of ways of
072_168_001_04_12 expressing Contempt for a man : and they are liable to be ex=

072_168_001_04_16 to offer a personal Injury : and in general the less atrocious an

071_181_003_04_01 Coin . It may happen that but a few are in this case ; but
071_181_003_04_02 it may happen that all are in the same case . It depends
071_181_003_04_03 upon the degree of currency which the foreign Coin in ques=
071_181_003_04_04 : tion may happen to have . Besides by knowing that a
071_181_003_04_05 fraud has been practised upon that Coin they know that there
071_181_003_04_06 is a criminal who has the inclination and the power to do
071_181_003_04_07 mischief in this way , or " yesterday " they will say to themselves ,
071_181_003_04_08 " he practised it upon foreign Coin ; but to morrow he may
071_181_003_04_09 practise it upon our own .
071_181_003_04_10 3 . The Profit is just the same : for the gain of half a
071_181_003_04_11 for example ,
071_181_003_04_12 crown , upon a Guinea is neither more nor less than that of half
071_181_003_04_13 a crown upon a louis-dor .
071_181_003_04_14 If an Offender thinks he can get off counterfeit foreign Coin
071_181_003_04_15 he will counterfeit foreign Coin ; if he does not think he can
071_181_003_04_16 get off counterfeit domestic Coin , he will not counterfeit do=

071_181_003_04_20 seems no reason to be given why it should be greater

115_110_002_04_02 opportunity of being acquainted with the history of
115_110_002_04_03 the treaty , Mr Bentham cannot but flatter himself
115_110_002_04_04 that what appears now to him as a hardship
115_110_002_04_05 upon Government would have appeared to him in a
115_110_002_04_06 different light . A proposition that seems to be
115_110_002_04_07 tacitly assumed is , that the money in question
115_110_002_04_08 is so much clear money out of the pocket of
115_110_002_04_09 Government on account of Mr Bentham ' s plan ,
115_110_002_04_10 over and above what it would have paid otherwise :
115_110_002_04_11 Whereas ( except as to an article of £6000 of which
115_110_002_04_12 presently ) Government is at no expence at all

116_046_001_02_04 " Individuals do not , from a sense of the terrible consequences to the

116_046_001_03_08 " now the case , the punishment proportioned to the crime , and
116_046_001_03_09 " are convinced of the utility of the scheme , will be less averse
116_046_001_03_10 " to investigate & and admit the proofs of guilt . The executive also
116_046_001_03_11 " has no sufficient motive to pardon a convict previous to the
116_046_001_03_12 " execution of his sentence , since at any time he has the power
116_046_001_03_13 " of doing it , after the criminal has demonstrated that he is
116_046_001_03_14 " worthy of the indulgence . This certainty of punishment has
116_046_001_03_15 " already proved a great check upon criminality " .

116_290_001_03_02 to " the Masters of the Transports " : and these men , instead of
116_290_001_03_03 bringing them to New South Wales , left them , or pretended to
116_290_001_03_04 have left them , with their owners in England . ( ) The story is as
116_290_001_03_05 curious as it is obscure : _ Papers sent from the Secretary of State ' s
116_290_001_03_06 Office , and directed either to the Governor , or to the Judge Advocate _
116_290_001_03_07 ( for to whom else could they have been directed ? ) Papers thus
116_290_001_03_08 directed , delivered _ not to the person in New South Wales to
116_290_001_03_09 whom they were directed _ but to a person in England who , had

116_290_001_04_02 ( ) Collins p . 74 July 1789 . Notwithstanding that little more than
116_290_001_04_03 " two years had elapsed since our departure from England , several convicts
116_290_001_04_04 " about this time signified about this time that the respective terms for
116_290_001_04_05 which they had been transported had expired , and claimed to be restored
116_290_001_04_06 " to the privileges of free men . Unfortunately , by some unaccountable
116_290_001_04_07 " oversight , the papers necessary to ascertain these particulars had been
116_290_001_04_08 " left by the Masters of the transports with their owners in England , instead
116_290_001_04_09 " of being brought out and deposited in the colony ; and as , thus situated ,
116_290_001_04_10 " it was equally impossible to admit or to deny the truth of their assertions ,
116_290_001_04_11 " they were told to wait until account could be received from England ; &
116_290_001_04_12 " in the mean time , by continuing to labour for the public , they would
116_290_001_04_13 " be entitled to share the public provisions in the store . This was by no means
116_290_001_04_14 " satisfactory , as it appeared that they expected an assurance from the governor
116_290_001_04_15 of receiving some gratuity for employing their future time and labour for the
116_290_001_04_16 " benefit of the settlement . ] One of these people having , in the presence of his
116_290_001_04_17 " excellency , expressed himself disrespectfully of the lieutenant-governor , he was
116_290_001_04_18 " brought before a criminal court and tried for the same , of which offence being
116_290_001_04_19 " found guilty , he was sentenced to receive six hundred lashes , and to wear

116_290_001_04_21 A " criminal court " ? What criminal court ? the court legalized by
116_290_001_04_22 the Act ? the cognizance of that Court is limited by the Act itself , to
116_290_001_04_23 such " outrages " and " misbehaviours " as would be " misdemeanors , felonies ,
116_290_001_04_24 " treasons or misprision thereof if committed within this realm " [ 27.G.3.c.2 ]
116_290_001_04_25 which of all these crimes then would a man committ in this realm

073_031_001_04_10 every now and then on of the people at large for an

115_078_001_02_05 in consequence whereof the effective power of the said proposed

071_185_003_05_03 in particular few are sufferers by it , but with their eyes open . By much
071_185_003_05_04 the greatest part of the counterfeit money is so palpably unlike , the im=
071_185_003_05_05 : posture is so gross , that it cannot pass upon any body who thinks it
071_185_003_05_06 worth his while to examine it with ever so little attention : so that the
071_185_003_05_07 mischief , though extensive , is not so great as one would imagine and the
071_185_003_05_08 low price of the metal effectually secures it against any contrivance that

071_128_001_05_01 Semi-public Offences , or Offences against a class of persons may
071_128_001_05_02 be distinguished in the first place into offences against a local class of
071_128_001_05_03 persons , or , in other words , into offences against a Neighborhood , and
071_128_001_05_04 Offences against an ideal class of persons , or in other words offences a=
071_128_001_05_05 =gainst a class of persons at large . By the former I mean all such
071_128_001_05_06 offences which a multitude of persons are exposed to suffer on account
071_128_001_05_07 of the proximity of the divisions of space which they happen res=
071_128_001_05_08 : pectively to occupy for the time being : that proximity being a
071_128_001_05_09 circumstance which denominates them neighbours to each other
071_128_001_05_10 and the whole tract of ground they occupy , the Neighbourhood . By
071_128_001_05_11 the latter I mean all offences which any such multitude of persons
071_128_001_05_12 are exposed to suffer by , as happen to be connected and brought
071_128_001_05_13 into the same predicament by any other circumstance .
071_128_001_05_14 Offences against a Neighbourhood may be distinguished in the
071_128_001_05_15 first place into such as are first rate crimes and such as are only offenc=
071_128_001_05_16 =es of an inferior rank . Under the former division I comprehend
071_128_001_05_17 the two Offences for which language has found names to wit Incen=
071_128_001_05_18 =diarism and Inundation . These will be treated of in form , each
071_128_001_05_19 under a title by itself . They are in fact but so many particular
071_128_001_05_20 destruction to
071_128_001_05_21 species of criminal destruction : an Offence , of which as well the pro=
071_128_001_05_22 : perty of assignable individuals as that of a Neighbourhood may

115_084_002_02_04 for the purpose of purchasing the same And Whereas he the
115_084_002_02_05 said Jeremy Bentham hath proposed at his own expence
115_084_002_02_06 but upon such terms and conditions and for such considera-
115_084_002_02_07 -tions as are hereinafter mentioned , to erect and adapt to the
115_084_002_02_08 purpose aforesaid a building of a new and peculiar nature
115_084_002_02_09 invented by Samuel Bentham Knight of the Military
115_084_002_02_10 Order of St George of Russia and Brigadier General in her
115_084_002_02_11 Imperial Majesty ' s Service , Brother of the said Jeremy
115_084_002_02_12 Bentham , under the name of a Panopticon or Inspection
115_084_002_02_13 House in and by means of which said Building any num-
115_084_002_02_14 -ber of persons may , in as far as it shall be thought
115_084_002_02_15 proper , be kept under the inspection of any person or number
115_084_002_02_16 of persons in charge thereof during any or every moment of
115_084_002_02_17 their respective lives Now these presents witness and the

071_106_002_04_01 under the auspices of the Laws . She is to be regarded therefore
071_106_002_04_02 on the footing of a Widow . In point of reason she ought not to
071_106_002_04_03 be regarded in a light in the least degree less favourable .
071_106_002_04_04 But popular prejudice is seldom perfectly equitable to
071_106_002_04_05 misfortune .
071_106_002_04_06 Next with regard to Sharping . It is not always that
071_106_002_04_07 a Woman thus imposed upon suffers in her fortune . Perhaps
071_106_002_04_08 she had none : the only bait that tempted the Offender was her
071_106_002_04_09 person . It is only in case of her having had a fortune , and
071_106_002_04_10 that fortune ' s having been dissipated by the Offender , that she
071_106_002_04_11 is a sufferer in this way . In the account of dissipation , so
071_106_002_04_12 much as it is supposed she would have expended had she
071_106_002_04_13 remained single , must be deducted .

071_106_002_04_17 The great mischief lies in the deceit put upon the Woman ,
071_106_002_04_18 and the disappointment which is apt to be the consequence . But
071_106_002_04_19 in this case there is no deceit nor disappointment . It is a joint

115_011_001_02_02 For a new and less expensive mode
115_011_001_02_03 of
115_011_001_02_04 employing and reforming Convicts .
115_011_001_02_05 The author , having turned his thoughts to the
115_011_001_02_06 Penitentiary System from its first origin , and having
115_011_001_02_07 lately contrived a building in which any number
115_011_001_02_08 of persons may be kept within the reach of being in-
115_011_001_02_09 -spected during every moment of their lives , and
115_011_001_02_10 having made out as he flatters himself to demonstration
115_011_001_02_11 that the only eligible mode of managing an establishment
115_011_001_02_12 of such a nature in a building of such construction
115_011_001_02_13 would be by contract , has been induced to make public
115_011_001_02_14 the following proposal for maintaining and employ-
115_011_001_02_15 -ing convicts in general , or such of them as would other-
115_011_001_02_16 -wise be confined on board the Hulks , for per Cent
115_011_001_02_17 less than it costs Government to maintain them
115_011_001_02_18 there at present , deducting also the average value
115_011_001_02_19 by them
115_011_001_02_20 of the work at present performed Government : _ _ _
115_011_001_02_21 upon the terms of his receiving the produce of
115_011_001_02_22 their labour , taking on himself the whole expence
115_011_001_02_23 of building without any advance to be made
115_011_001_02_24 by Government for what purpose , requiring only
115_011_001_02_25 that the abatement and deduction abovementi-
115_011_001_02_26 -oned shall be suspended for the first year .
115_011_001_02_27 Upon the abovementioned terms he would engage
115_011_001_02_28 as follows .
115_011_001_02_29 1.st To furnish the Prisoners with a constant supply
115_011_001_02_30 of wholesome food , [ not limited in quantity , but ade-
115_011_001_02_31 -quate to each man ' s desires . ]
115_011_001_02_32 2nd To keep them clad in a state of tightness and neat-
115_011_001_02_33 -ness [ superior to what is usual among the lower
115_011_001_02_34 classes or even in the improved prisons . ]
115_011_001_02_35 3rd To keep them supplied with separate beds and bed-
115_011_001_02_36 -ding competent to their situation , and in a state
115_011_001_02_37 of cleanliness [ scarce any where conjoined with li-
115_011_001_02_38 -berty . ]
096_017_003_01_01 To be copied
096_017_003_02_01 and only so far , as they are admitted by the
096_017_003_02_02 laws of the land .
096_017_003_02_03 Had our Author consulted the history of other
096_017_003_02_04 nations , he would have seen , into what incon-
096_017_003_02_05 -veniences , errors , and absurdities , the Jews , the
096_017_003_02_06 Egyptians , and the Romans , after the introduct-
096_017_003_02_07 -ion of Christianity , were drawn , by thus con-
096_017_003_02_08 -founding the extent of the operation of civil , and
096_017_003_02_09 religious laws . Had he looked into the history
096_017_003_02_10 of our own country , he would have known
096_017_003_02_11 seen learnt , that the pretences of many of
096_017_003_02_12 our kings to absolute , and arbitrary power ,
096_017_003_02_13 were often founded upon , and always _
096_017_003_02_14 term
096_017_003_02_15 strengthened by , the misapplication of a
096_017_003_02_16 47

072_054_002_02_01 C
072_054_002_03_01 Offences against the National Interest in general .
072_054_002_04_01 A caution to the Legislator _ This title is a very ample one , as
072_054_002_04_02 such a very loose one and on that account very liable to be abused . It
072_054_002_04_03 would be abusing it , if he made use of it for a receptacle for such
072_054_002_04_04 acts as he could not discover to be productive of any particular
072_054_002_04_05 kind of mischief . There is in short but one case in which he can
072_054_002_04_06 stand justified , for putting any kind of act under this title ; that
072_054_002_04_07 is where the same sort of act is liable at one time to be produc=
072_054_002_04_08 : tive of mischief in one way , at another time of another : but at
072_054_002_04_09 any rate in some one or other of the ways specified under the pre=
072_054_002_04_10 : ceding titles . If not he has no better warrant for putting it
072_054_002_04_11 here than any where else . At present when a Legislator has a
072_054_002_04_12 mind to punish an act , and he cannot tell why , he calls it an
072_054_002_04_13 offence against good order . Let him take care that the class here in
072_054_002_04_14 question be not made the same ill use of .
072_054_002_04_15 Among the Offences which can with propriety be placed
072_054_002_04_16 upon this uncertain ground I can find no other than the following :
072_054_002_04_17 1 . Taking without leave of the government a pension or present from
072_054_002_04_18 a foreign state in amity .
072_054_002_04_19 The state in question by the supposition possesses an exterior amity .

116_648_001_03_04 into a Negotiation with England .
116_648_001_03_05 . . . Let us determine what reliance we can place on his engagements

116_648_001_03_09 Character of Buonaparte . Extracted from the Appendix to Mr Windham ' s
116_648_001_03_10 speech , delivered in the House of Commons , on the 4th of Novr 1801 , on the
116_648_001_03_11 Report of an address to the Throne , approving of the Preliminaries of
116_648_001_03_12 Peace with the Republic of France _
116_648_001_03_13 . . . A detailed & most masterly exposition of these is to be found
116_648_001_03_14 in Mr Pitt ' s speech of the 3 Feby 1800 , in which among other particulars ,
116_648_001_03_15 an account is given of his proceedings toward the people and govern-
116_648_001_03_16 -ments of the several states of Milan , Modena , Genoa , Tuscany , the
116_648_001_03_17 Pope , Venice , & Egypt . Of all these things it may be said generally , & as
116_648_001_03_18 it should seem without exception , _ such was purposely the profusion of
116_648_001_03_19 engagements , & such the uniform and systematic breach of them , _ that
116_648_001_03_20 not a single act was done , which was not in violation of some engage-
116_648_001_03_21 -ment , & certainly not a single engagement contracted , or profession made ,
116_648_001_03_22 that was not , in every part of it , grossly and in most cases instantly violated .
116_648_001_03_23 The french rulers , have , throughout , evidently acted upon the principle ,
116_648_001_03_24 that he who could divest himself at once of all moral feeling , and
116_648_001_03_25 release himself from all moral controull controul , must for the time
116_648_001_03_26 have an immense advantage over those who should remain under the
116_648_001_03_27 old constraints , and who might not be sensible immediately of the change
116_648_001_03_28 which had taken place , or , when they were , might be long incapable either
116_648_001_03_29 of adopting it into their own conduct , or of so unseating their antient feelings
116_648_001_03_30 and habits ( the habit for instance of relying in some degree on men ' s
116_648_001_03_31 apearances , yielding something to their professions , believing in part what they
116_648_001_03_32 should solemnly assert ) , as to make themselves proof against its effects .
116_648_001_03_33 Nobody has entered more fully into their views , or pursued them logically
116_648_001_03_34 , than the person of whom we are here speaking .
116_648_001_03_35 H p . xliii
116_648_001_03_36 The detail of this would then , that mere change of time and place made no
116_648_001_03_37 change in the character of the person , or of the system pursued . It appears by all ,
116_648_001_03_38 that good faith passed for small nothing : that deceptions the most gross ,
116_648_001_03_39 artifices unheard of in diplomatic proceedings , even practiced without
116_648_001_03_40 shame or scruple . When a party was once engaged in a negotiation , &
116_648_001_03_41 placed in a said situation in which he could no longer help himself ,
116_648_001_03_42 it was in vain to expect that any regard would be paid to the professions
116_648_001_03_43 in which the negotiation began , or to declarations which occurred in the course
116_648_001_03_44 of it . Any old engagement was set aside , or any new one foisted in , as suited
116_648_001_03_45 the wishes , original or incidental , which France happened to entertain .
116_648_001_03_46 H . p . xlvi
116_648_001_03_47 Such is the deplorable laxness of mankind , such the abject hommage
116_648_001_03_48 which men are willing to pay to crimes attended with success , to wickedness
116_648_001_03_49 united with power , that none of the acts committed at any time by the
116_648_001_03_50 agents of the French government , seem at all to have hurt their reception
116_648_001_03_51 in the world , either collectively or individually . Their oppressions & cruelties excite
116_648_001_03_52 no indignation ; their low and scandalous frauds no contempt ; their treacheries
116_648_001_03_53 no distrust . _

096_052_002_02_01 Sect . I . Law in General .
096_052_002_03_01 If we look to see this rule observed by our Author , we shall be disap -
096_052_002_03_02 It
096_052_002_03_03 -pointed In this there is not much to wonder at . But it is not
096_052_002_03_04 uncommon to observe the attention flag and by the time a numer
096_052_002_03_05 ous train of species have been displayed let the true that is the
096_052_002_03_06 originally assumed character of the genus slip insensibly out
096_052_002_03_07 of the memory , and a spurious one steal into it ' s place . But _
096_052_002_03_08 what is uncommon , is to find this falsification take place in
096_052_002_03_09 the first instance : and to see a part of the generic character _
096_052_002_03_10 wanting in the very first instance of all that is adduced . This
096_052_002_03_11 however is the ease here .
096_052_002_03_12 The reason is not difficult to percieve . The general character of
096_052_002_03_13 Law was taken from that species which in truth is the only one
096_052_002_03_14 that which our Author calls Municipal , the Law that a part of
096_052_002_03_15 the persons in in a state make for the rest . Meantime it was this
096_052_002_03_16 misfortune to come to the business already determined to find _
096_052_002_03_17 some other sorts , and these from some fancied pre-eminence , were
096_052_002_03_18 to be mentioned first . This being his predetermination There was
096_052_002_03_19 but one thing his invention could do to help delude his judgment
096_052_002_03_20 and that was , to find a word of such convenient obscurity , as
096_052_002_03_21 might put a mask on the generic character so that the repug-
096_052_002_03_22 -nances between the first species and those that were to follow _
096_052_002_03_23 no
096_052_002_03_24 might pass off unperceived . For this purpose a word could not
096_052_002_03_25 be better calculated than the word " prescribed : " It might upon oc-
096_052_002_03_26 -casion signify writing , speaking or any mode of utterance wherein

071_053_003_03_04 think would upon trial be found to be so infinite=
071_053_003_03_05 ly are the incidents from which such opportu=
071_053_003_03_06 =nities may take their rise . It seems hardly worth while
071_053_003_03_07 r
071_053_003_03_08 to appoint an extrao dinary punishment which could ap=
071_053_003_03_09 =ply in but a small proportion of the cases in which there
071_053_003_03_10 r
071_053_003_03_11 was a demand for it . The benefit produced by an extrao dinary
071_053_003_03_12 provision for that purpose would hardly make up for the incon-
071_053_003_03_13 -venience that might result from the addition such a provision
071_053_003_03_14 voluminousness
071_053_003_03_15 it would make to the voluminuousness and intricacy of the
071_053_003_03_16 penal code : such a provision would hardly pay for its place in
071_053_003_03_17 the catalogue of punishments .
071_053_003_03_18 3 . Another reason against applying extraodinary punishment
071_053_003_03_19 in the case of domestic theft is their being subject to a
071_053_003_03_20 In England the
071_053_003_03_21 check to which either strangers are not exposed . The most
071_053_003_03_22 servant
071_053_003_03_23 valuable possession a stranger has is his character this
071_053_003_03_24 character is his great trust and dependence and support

116_631_002_02_01 " I verily believe , to expend from the public purse

116_631_002_02_03 " to the community than that which is here pointed out " . *
116_631_002_02_04 Thus far the worthy Magistrate . - A supposition ,
116_631_002_02_05 unquestionably though tacitly assumed in the hypothe-
116_631_002_02_06 -tical offer thus made by him , is _ that on the other
116_631_002_02_07 part some regard would be paid to the ruler of
116_631_002_02_08 common honesty ; that the County would not be made
116_631_002_02_09 bankrupt to him , as Parliament has been made
116_631_002_02_10 to me : and that after his proposal had been
116_631_002_02_11 accepted , his capital with the concurrence of the
116_631_002_02_12 acceptors as advanced upon the faith of it , and Acts
116_631_002_02_13 of Parliament , if necessary , obtained for it , he would
116_631_002_02_14 not have to see the execution of it set down in petto
116_631_002_02_15 for the Greek calends , by any such person as the
116_631_002_02_16 predecessor of the " great person " he is so afraid of
116_631_002_02_17 flattering _ not to speak of successors . _ To the
116_631_002_02_18 not add to the County rates the worthy Magistrate ' s own imagination
116_631_002_02_19 ( Your Lordship may venture to assure him ) is the likeliest place for
116_631_002_02_20 finding what he wants . Years ago he would restrain vice & improve
116_631_002_02_21 morals without adding to County rates would have made his appear-
116_631_002_02_22 -ance had there been any such person in existence . An Acct of
116_631_002_02_23 Parliament for doing all this _ an establishment which in
116_631_002_02_24 the opinion of Parliament would do all this _ would restrain
116_631_002_02_25 vice and improve morals without adding to the County rates _
116_631_002_02_26 has by Parliament been ordered to be set up for above these
116_631_002_02_27 8 years . Whatever be the thing needful join will to power
116_631_002_02_28 and the thing is done . Power for this there has been all this
116_631_002_02_29 time beyond dispute in a certain place : - Duty there has
116_631_002_02_30 always been : full knowledge of that duty there has always
116_631_002_02_31 been : _ had will been in the same place the thing would have
116_631_002_02_32 been done years ago , & neither the worthy Magistrate nor so
116_631_002_02_33 many other people would have been left at this time of day
116_631_002_02_34 to amuse themselves with " hopes " and " expectations " . _
116_631_002_02_35 * Here the worthy Magistrate is quite mistaken . " I can

071_167_002_04_03 to counterfeit , that the Loss will be very inconsiderable .
071_167_002_04_04 The expence of the Operation will certainly be something ,

115_076_001_02_02 afterwards made by the said Architects would for the said
115_076_001_02_03 number of 1000 have amounted to £183,652,,4,,5 1/4 , exclusive of
115_076_001_02_04 the expences of fitting up and stocking the said Establish-
115_076_001_02_05 -ment ; all which expences together , considering the usual and
115_076_001_02_06 almost unavoidable difference between estimated and actual ex-
115_076_001_02_07 -pence , could not reasonably be reckoned at less than £215,000
115_076_001_02_08 in the whole ; insomuch that the said Jeremy Bentham , whenso-
115_076_001_02_09 -ever he shall have fulfilled the present agreement in relation
115_076_001_02_10 said including
115_076_001_02_11 to the intended establishment , with the fitting up and stocking
115_076_001_02_12 of the same , may reasonably be computed to have saved to the pub-
115_076_001_02_13 the said
115_076_001_02_14 -lic to the amount of at least £200,000 out of £215,000 in
115_076_001_02_15 at the least
115_076_001_02_16 respect of the same . And Whereas the sum of £15,000 ,
115_076_001_02_17 ( being all that will remain of the said allowed sum of
115_076_001_02_18 £27,000 after setting a part the sum of £12,000 for the
115_076_001_02_19 maintenance of the said thousand Prisoners for one year )
115_076_001_02_20 is not by any means a sufficient allowance for the expence
115_076_001_02_21 of building fitting up and stocking as aforesaid but only a par-
115_076_001_02_22 -tial allowance towards the same the bulk of the expenditure ne-
115_076_001_02_23 -cessary for the same being accordingly made up or to be made
115_076_001_02_24 up by and out of the private fortune ,or saved by the ingenuity
115_076_001_02_25 of the said Jeremy and the said Samuel Bentham or one of
115_076_001_02_26 them And Whereas if such Buildings Improvements and
115_076_001_02_27 Stock were not to be the property of the said intended Mana-

002_541_001_02_01 Ch . III . Grounds of Expectation with regard to the circulation etc of the
002_541_001_02_02 proposed paper .
002_541_001_02_03 To enable this Paper to answer the expectations that have been
002_541_001_02_04 seven
002_541_001_02_05 been formed of it six distinguishable results must take place : _
002_541_001_02_06 1 . It must meet with purchasers to take it out in the way of issue . _
002_541_001_02_07 2 . And that at the price proposed to be put upon it .
002_541_001_02_08 3 . It must be received in circulation _
002_541_001_02_09 4 . _ And at that price _
002_541_001_02_10 5 . _ And with an addition proportioned each day to the amount of Interest
002_541_001_02_11 due upon it .
002_541_001_02_12 6 . It must be depretiation proof : _ being current on the above footing
002_541_001_02_13 and without discount not only at its birth but through every stage
002_541_001_02_14 of its existence .
002_541_001_02_15 7 . Its currency must be universal : _ not confined to this or that
002_541_001_02_16 description of persons but extending to all descriptions . _
002_541_001_02_17 Of its pretensions to the above attributes some judgment may
002_541_001_02_18 already have been formed from the preceding they will now
002_541_001_02_19 be subjected to a closer scrutiny . _

115_008_002_02_01 that not only on Sundays at the time of Divine
115_008_002_02_02 Service , but on ordinary days at meal times or times
115_008_002_02_03 of work : providing thereby a system of superin-
115_008_002_02_04 -tendence , universal , unchargeable , and uninterrupt-
115_008_002_02_05 -ed , the most effectual and indestructible of all secu-
115_008_002_02_06 -rities against abuse .
115_008_002_02_07 Such are the methods that have occurred to him
115_008_002_02_08 for the accomplishing that identification of interest with
115_008_002_02_09 duty , the effectuating of which in the person of the
115_008_002_02_10 Governor , is declared to be one of the leading objects of
115_008_002_02_11 the Penitentiary Act .
115_008_002_02_12 The station of Jailor is not in common account
115_008_002_02_13 a very elevated one : the addition of Contractor has
115_008_002_02_14 not much tendency to raise it . He little dreamt , when
115_008_002_02_15 he first launched into the subject , that he was to become
115_008_002_02_16 a suitor , and perhaps in vain , for such an office . But
115_008_002_02_17 inventions unpractised might be in want of the in-
115_008_002_02_18 -ventor : and a situation , thus clipped of emoluments
115_008_002_02_19 while it was loaded with obligations , might be in want
115_008_002_02_20 of candidates . Penetrated therefore with the importance
115_008_002_02_21 of the end , he would not suffer himself to see any
115_008_002_02_22 thing unpleasant or discreditable in the means .
115_086_003_01_01 11
115_086_003_02_01 Art.17 . In case of Escape the said Jeremy Bentham
115_086_003_02_02 and his said Successors shall respectively be made Debtors
115_086_003_02_03 in their quarterly account to the amount of £50 for every instance
115_086_003_02_04 of such escape , irresistible violence from without excepted : pro-
115_086_003_02_05 -vided that they shall be made Creditors to the like amount in
115_086_003_02_06 case of recapture .
115_086_003_02_07 Art.18 . The life of each Prisoner is to be insured by the
115_086_003_02_08 said Jeremy Bentham and his Successors at the rate of £100 a
115_086_003_02_09 head for a proportionable premium to be paid by the said
115_086_003_02_10 Lords Commissioners and their Successors as follows . A compu-
115_086_003_02_11 -tation shall be formed of the number of deaths that may be
115_086_003_02_12 expected to take place among the Prisoners in the course of
115_086_003_02_13 each year out of the said number of a thousand Prisoners
115_086_003_02_14 living at the commencement of such year , taking for the
115_086_003_02_15 sum total of
115_086_003_02_16 standard the annual proportion of the deaths at the end of
115_086_003_02_17 a year to that of persons living at the commencement of the
115_086_003_02_18 said year , according to the London Bills of Mortality , and
115_086_003_02_19 ' the calculations thereon grounded by the late Rev : d Dr Price .
115_086_003_02_20 Such computation being made , the said Jeremy Bentham &
115_086_003_02_21 his Successors shall at the end of each year be on the one
115_086_003_02_22 hand be made Creditors to the amount of £100 for every death
115_086_003_02_23 which in the course of the said year might according to such
115_086_003_02_24 computation have been expected to take place among the said
115_086_003_02_25 Prisoners , and on the other hand Debtors to the said amount
115_086_003_02_26 of £100 for every death which within the said period shall
115_086_003_02_27 actually have taken place . As for example , suppose the number
115_086_003_02_28 of deaths expected to have taken place at the end of the year
115_086_003_02_29 to be to the number of persons living at the commencement
115_086_003_02_30 of the said year as 1 to 25 , this for the said intended number
115_086_003_02_31 of

072_066_002_02_01 C
072_066_002_03_01 Of Idleness .
072_066_002_04_01 is the pain of sympathy . This then is aleady an evil .
072_066_002_04_02 If it be without their consent , it assumes necessarily the
072_066_002_04_03 shape of some one or other of the offences against the pro :
072_066_002_04_04 : perty of individuals ; it changes its nature and becomes
072_066_002_04_05 an offence against individuals .
072_066_002_04_06 Idleness then , when the result of choice and ac :
072_066_002_04_07 : companied by indigence , is obviously a proper object
072_066_002_04_08 of coercion . But is it the result of choice ? This
072_066_002_04_09 is a fact which it is highly necessary should be as :
072_066_002_04_10 : certained before the coercion is applied . All other
072_066_002_04_11 species of delinquency have this in common that the
072_066_002_04_12 depends
072_066_002_04_13 avoiding them altogether depends upon the deliquent .
072_066_002_04_14 This is not the case with idleness : since for a man to
072_066_002_04_15 have employment , two parties must concur : himself
072_066_002_04_16 to accept it , and somebody else to give it him . It is
072_066_002_04_17 plain therefore that the Legislator before he can , with
072_066_002_04_18 any degree of Justice , punish idleness , or before he can
072_066_002_04_19 even be entitled to lament it as a misforturne , ought so to
072_066_002_04_20 order matters that whosoever stands in need of employ
072_066_002_04_21 : ment may be sure to meet with it . This can only
072_066_002_04_22 be

071_183_004_03_01 Of Frauds relative to the Coin .
071_183_004_04_01 only be practised upon a chance opportunity for the sake of
071_183_004_04_02 a small and transient Profit .
071_183_004_04_03 In this respect , this offence stands upon nearly the footing
071_183_004_04_04 with that of Cheating by false Weights and Measures : with this
071_183_004_04_05 difference that the Offender is not likely to be so responsible in
071_183_004_04_06 the former Case as in the latter . The Stock and Substance
071_183_004_04_07 of the Tradesman who sells the produce of the labour of a mul=
071_183_004_04_08 : titude of workmen , is in general much greater , than that of the
071_183_004_04_09 workman whose dealings are confined to the produce of his
071_183_004_04_10 own .
071_183_004_04_11 Robbery being an Offence against Property and Person both
071_183_004_04_12 is a much more mischievous offence than Theft or any Fraud upon
071_183_004_04_13 Property or , in short , than any offence against Person and Property
071_183_004_04_14 alone . It would therefore be a very mischievous measure to turn
071_183_004_04_15 a Thief into a Robber . Such would be the case if the Punish=
071_183_004_04_16 : ment for Theft were severer than that of Robbery . For these
071_183_004_04_17 are Crimes that are apt constantly to come in competition ; crimes
071_183_004_04_18 to the temptation of which the same person is apt to be exposed .

096_018_002_01_01 to a state of society , that is , to a State , where
096_018_002_01_02 positive law must be superadded , not to re-
096_018_002_01_03 -strain , but to direct , the original impulses of
096_018_002_01_04 nature , he would have furnished us with the
096_018_002_01_05 only Criterion , according to which any law
096_018_002_01_06 by which alone , laws may be determined to
096_018_002_01_07 be good , or bad : right , or wrong : he would have
096_018_002_01_08 given the only clue , which can explain to
096_018_002_01_09 us the various , and seemingly irreconcile-
096_018_002_01_10 -able differences in the various laws , and
096_018_002_01_11 manners , and Customs , of different ages ,
096_018_002_01_12 and nations : and he would have afforded
096_018_002_01_13 the noblest incitement to the Study of the law
096_018_002_01_14 of which the human mind is capable .

071_130_003_04_02 and prudence . To take the measures necessary for this purpose
071_130_003_04_03 requires the political power as well as Scientific contrivance of
071_130_003_04_04 the Sovereign or those who act under his authority . It requires
071_130_003_04_05 certain [ + ]
071_130_003_04_06 a system of political regulations to be made which will of
071_130_003_04_07 course be different , according to the different calamities which
071_130_003_04_08 they are calculated to obviate . Till these regulations are
071_130_003_04_09 made , it will in most cases be difficult to say what par=
071_130_003_04_10 : ticular acts have any particular tendency to promote
071_130_003_04_11 any given article in the list of those calamities . Such of-
071_130_003_04_12 -fences will most of them be in that case in which the motive
071_130_003_04_13 for punishing exists not before the law is made . The law must
071_130_003_04_14 be made before the acts which it prohibits can be seen clearly
071_130_003_04_15 to be of pernicious tendency . As in these cases it will be impos=
071_130_003_04_16 : sible to ascertain the description of the Offence until the regula-
071_130_003_04_17 : tions be given which it tends to counteract , those regulations
071_130_003_04_18 must be given before the mischievousness of the Offence can be
071_130_003_04_19 estimated and the punishment of it determined . But these
071_130_003_04_20 regulations are altogether dependent upon local considerations .
071_130_003_04_21 It is evident therefore that no place can be allotted to them
071_130_003_04_22 here .
071_130_003_04_23 It may be of use however to take a cursory view of the ge=
071_130_003_04_24 : neral tendency of such regulations if it were only to justify the

115_087_004_02_07 said Act might if some provision were not herein & hereby

115_087_004_02_09 and so occupy or dispose of the same as to deprive the legal

096_008_002_02_02 way to a clear knowledge of Jurisprudence
096_008_002_02_03 by such unintelligible Jargon as this . Our
096_008_002_02_04 Ancestors had been accustomed to hear _
096_008_002_02_05 these absurdities from the pulpits , while it
096_008_002_02_06 was possesst by Monkish ignorance : As the
096_008_002_02_07 progress of reformation is slow , we are not
096_008_002_02_08 always shocked at ithem , when we som by
096_008_002_02_09 chance we hear something like them from
096_008_002_02_10 the same Place . But , surely , in these en-
096_008_002_02_11 lightened Days every man must feel in-
096_008_002_02_12 dignation when he hears sees an eminent
096_008_002_02_13 Writer on jurisprudence paint the Creator ,
096_008_002_02_14 in the odious colors of an Egyptian task Master .

071_054_001_03_03 Government of a good man is like that of a father The
071_054_001_03_04 of filial
071_054_001_03_05 obedience a good servant has something in it of persons
071_054_001_03_06 Duty . They are continually in each others presence : they
071_054_001_03_07 have frequent occasions to converse & they become habituated
071_054_001_03_08 to each other : a look of plaintive reproach from a servant
071_054_001_03_09 excite
071_054_001_03_10 where his master is dragging to prison must a
071_054_001_03_11 much different and much tenderer sensation in his pro=
071_054_001_03_12 =secutor than the severe look from a stranger would under
071_054_001_03_13 the like circumstances . A servant is much more likely
071_054_001_03_14 to find advocates and intercessors among the friends and
071_054_001_03_15 relations of the family .
071_054_001_03_16 Another thing is that people at large fail not to take
071_054_001_03_17 the circumstance into consideration . They expect that un=
071_054_001_03_18 =less these be something particularly atrocious in the case
071_054_001_03_19 the servant shall be forgiven . The master is sensible of
071_054_001_03_20 this which is a farther circumstance that contibutes to
071_054_001_03_21 deter him from prosecuting .
071_054_001_03_22 All these considerations make it more difficult to get
071_054_001_03_23 a man to prosecute his servant than a stranger even where

071_168_003_05_02 bad money at the price of genuine . The reason indeed given is
071_168_003_05_03 that " the utterers often are the Coiners or in confederacy with them " ;
071_168_003_05_04 but the conviction is not made to depend in any manner upon
071_168_003_05_05 the Jury ' s persuasion of that circumstance . The punishment is
071_168_003_05_06 for the first offence Six Months imprisonment ; for the Second
071_168_003_05_07 Two Years Imprisonment ; and for the Third , Death .
071_168_003_05_08 This statute , as any one may imagine , is not executed .
071_168_003_05_09 If it were there are few persons in the nation who might not

071_168_003_05_12 With regard to the Copper Coin every body knows that
071_168_003_05_13 it is not all uncommon for counterfeit halfpence to be passed
071_168_003_05_14 off , not only knowingly but avowedly ; since it is not at all
071_168_003_05_15 uncommon for people even knowingly to accept them . When
071_168_003_05_16 this is the case it is generally owing to the indifference with
071_168_003_05_17 which the matter is regarded on both sides , on account of the
071_168_003_05_18 triflingness of the sum and the assurance which the accept=
071_168_003_05_19 : or has of being able to pass off the money to some other per
071_168_003_05_20 =son . This holds good in a less degree with regard to the silver

115_009_001_03_01 Proposal
115_009_001_03_02 For a new and less expensive mode
115_009_001_03_03 of
115_009_001_03_04 employing and reforming Convicts .
115_009_001_03_05 The author , having turned his thoughts to the Peni-
115_009_001_03_06 -tentiary System from its first origin , and having lately
115_009_001_03_07 contrived a building in which any number of persons
115_009_001_03_08 may be kept within the reach of being inspected during
115_009_001_03_09 every moment of their lives , and having made out
115_009_001_03_10 as he flatters himself to demonstration , that the on-
115_009_001_03_11 -ly eligible mode of managing an establishment
115_009_001_03_12 of such a nature , in a building of such a construct-
115_009_001_03_13 -ion would be by contract , has been induced to make
115_009_001_03_14 public the following proposal for maintaining and
115_009_001_03_15 employing convicts in general , or such of them as
115_009_001_03_16 would otherwise be confined on board the Hulks for
115_009_001_03_17 25 . per Cent less than it costs Government to main-
115_009_001_03_18 -tain them there at present ; deducting also the ave-
115_009_001_03_19 -rage value of the work at present performed by them
115_009_001_03_20 for Government : upon the terms of his receiving
115_009_001_03_21 the produce of their labour , taking on himself the
115_009_001_03_22 whole expence of building , without any advance
115_009_001_03_23 to be made by Government for that purpose , re-
115_009_001_03_24 -quiring only that the abatement & deduction a-
115_009_001_03_25 -bovementioned shall be suspended for the first
115_009_001_03_26 year .

116_607_001_03_01 instruction , is a school the less a school because
116_607_001_03_02 the body boys are not always in the school room ?
116_607_001_03_03 Separation however , even though carried to
116_607_001_03_04 the length of solitude , is not of itself sufficient
116_607_001_03_05 for reformation . To reformation , occupation is
116_607_001_03_06 necessary : occupation , profitable or at least innocent ,
116_607_001_03_07 to fill up the mind with useful ideas or at
116_607_001_03_08 least innocent ones , and by that repletion to
116_607_001_03_09 exclude mischievous ones . _
116_607_001_03_10 Inclosed space , for whatever purpose , is not
116_607_001_03_11 to be had without expence . To pay for that
116_607_001_03_12 expence if work be proposed to be done , it is
116_607_001_03_13 necessary not only that work shall be done , but
116_607_001_03_14 done in such quantity and such quality , as to
116_607_001_03_15 equal the expence . It is in this way that the
116_607_001_03_16 interests of reformation and those of economy
116_607_001_03_17 are intimately blended and connected . Work of
116_607_001_03_18 some sort or other , profitable or not profitable in
116_607_001_03_19 point of economy , is necessary for reformation . But
116_607_001_03_20 the less the expence of reformation , the less it will
116_607_001_03_21 be grudged .
116_607_001_03_22 Grudged ? _ says a voice somewh somewhere _

071_128_003_04_02 is upheld : the district by which the road , the bridge , the aqueduct , the
071_128_003_04_03 church , ( or whatever it be ) is kept in repair : so much as regards the
071_128_003_04_04 consequential damage will commonly fall principally to the share
071_128_003_04_05 of Individuals : of such Individuals to wit who happens to have
071_128_003_04_06 sustained a special damage by reason of the mischief done to that
071_128_003_04_07 article of common property which is in question . The distinction
071_128_003_04_08 between ordinary articles and such as are irreplaceable is of more
071_128_003_04_09 particular use here than with regard to such articles as are the pro=
071_128_003_04_10 : perty of an individual . The impractibility of replacing the arti=
071_128_003_04_11 : cle is more apt indeed in this case to regard the time than the
071_128_003_04_12 thing itself . A bridge , a road , a ferry-boat , an aqueduct can
071_128_003_04_13 always be replaced or repaired at the long run ; though it may
071_128_003_04_14 require a considerable length of time to accomplish that effect :
071_128_003_04_15 during which interval a great deal of consequential damage may
071_128_003_04_16 have been incurred . In some cases however the thing may chance
071_128_003_04_17 to be absolutely irreplaceable : particularly when it happens to be
071_128_003_04_18 some rare and ornamental work of Art . Who for instance could
071_128_003_04_19 make sure of finding a second Falconet to replace the statue of
071_128_003_04_20 Peter the Great at Petersburgh ? Or a second Pigal to replace
071_128_003_04_21 that of Louis the 15th at Paris ?

116_076_001_02_04 complaints and " petitions from the settlers there ( on Norfolk Island )
116_076_001_02_05 " he caused the following order to be printed and sent thither
116_076_001_02_06 " for their information :
116_076_001_02_07 ' From the nature of the difficulties of which the settlers
116_076_001_02_08 ' upon Norfolk-Island have complained , difficulties which have not
116_076_001_02_09 ' until very lately been known to have an existence , the governor
116_076_001_02_10 ' is led to suspect , that the same rage for traffic , and & an intem-
116_076_001_02_11 - ' perate ' indulgence in some of those destructive gratifications which
116_076_001_02_12 ' have so effectually ruined many of the most forward & promising
116_076_001_02_13 ' settlers in New South Wales , have reached Norfolk-Island . _
116_076_001_02_14 ' His Excellency , from an earnest desire to promote the prosperity
116_076_001_02_15 ' of the island , and the true happiness of its inhabitants , has ,
116_076_001_02_16 ' since his arrival in this country , availed himself of every
116_076_001_02_17 ' opportunity of forwarding for their accommodation a share of such
116_076_001_02_18 ' little comforts , as accidental ships may have brought hither . But ,
116_076_001_02_19 ' he is sorry to observe , that , instead of those attentions being felt
116_076_001_02_20 ' as an advantage , they appear only to operate as an incitement
116_076_001_02_21 ' to more extensive dealings ; a circumstance which he foresees
116_076_001_02_22 ' must end in the ruin of many of the settlers , for whose
116_076_001_02_23 ' welfare he is extremely anxious . He therefore urges them not
116_076_001_02_24 ' to be led away from their real interest , by speculative
116_076_001_02_25 ' ideas , or a desire of indulging in dangerous gratifications ,
116_076_001_02_26 ' squandering the whole produce of their hard labour in trifles ,
116_076_001_02_27 ' or in scenes of dissipation which must eventually end in
116_076_001_02_28 ' their complete ruin . He desires that they will persevere with
116_076_001_02_29 ' patience in the management of their farms , and the rearing
116_076_001_02_30 of ' stock ; and assures them that he has taken such steps
116_076_001_02_31 ' as he hopes will incline the government to consider the
116_076_001_02_32 ' inconveniencies which are sustained in this distant part
116_076_001_02_33 ' of the world , and induce them to adopt such measures as
116_076_001_02_34 ' will promise the colonists , before long , every European article
116_076_001_02_35 ' that they may have occasion for at a very moderate expence ;
116_076_001_02_36 ' and by that means put an effectual stop to the impositions
116_076_001_02_37 ' under which the industrious settlers have too long laboured . "

071_183_001_05_02 there is in England ; and on the other hand there is much less
071_183_001_05_03 Gold . In England there is a vast quantity of Paper-money in cir=

071_183_001_05_10 : ratively but rare . In England at present there is now
071_183_001_05_11 and then a little bad Gold , there is a great deal of bad

115_086_004_02_01 of 1000 Prisoners will make 40 deaths : £4000 then will be
115_086_004_02_02 the sum which the said intended Governor will annually
115_086_004_02_03 be made Creditor for upon the supposition of his receiving
115_086_004_02_04 the said number of 1000 Prisoners : and as he will be made
115_086_004_02_05 Debtor to the said amount of £100 for every one which du-
115_086_004_02_06 -ring the said period shall actually have died , it follows that
115_086_004_02_07 if 40 , as expected , shall have died , neither more nor less , he
115_086_004_02_08 will have nothing either to receive or to pay : if , instead of
115_086_004_02_09 40 , 41 , then he will have to pay to the amount of £100 ; if
115_086_004_02_10 instead of 40 , 39 , then he will have to receive to the said am-
115_086_004_02_11 -ount . But £4000 for 1000 Prisoners is the same proportion
115_086_004_02_12 as £4 for 1 Prisoner : it follows therefore that according to
115_086_004_02_13 the above computation , £4 will be the premium for which such
115_086_004_02_14 intended Governor will be to be made Creditor on account
115_086_004_02_15 of any individual Prisoner on the day which delivered to his
115_086_004_02_16 charge , on condition of his being made Debtor to the amount
115_086_004_02_17 of £100 in the event of such Prisoner ' s dying in his custody
115_086_004_02_18 within the compass of a year reckoning from the said day :
115_086_004_02_19 and so in proportion for any term less than a year
115_086_004_02_20 Moreover in case of any dispute touching the amount of
115_086_004_02_21 such premium or the payment of the said eventual head-
115_086_004_02_22 -money of £100 according to the rate of calculation herein
115_086_004_02_23 above fixed , the same shall be settled by arbitration as above .

116_642_001_02_03 in a situation always besigged besieged by candidates :
116_642_001_02_04 an Act to increase his recompense , the other to
116_642_001_02_05 reduce his service .
116_642_001_02_06 But , Sir , what ground for all this ? Is there
116_642_001_02_07 to be no end of all this malice _ of all these impu-
116_642_001_02_08 -tations _ these uncandid these envenomed insinuations ?
116_642_001_02_09 My Lord , my answer is as distinct as possible .
116_642_001_02_10 Four features _ four antecedent features _ betray , even of
116_642_001_02_11 themselves the complexion of the business .
116_642_001_02_12 First the existence of such an abuse _ and for
116_642_001_02_13 such a length of time _ year after year _ under the
116_642_001_02_14 very noses _ ( the term is a coarse one _ under the
116_642_001_02_15 eyes I should have said , had gentlemen chosen to
116_642_001_02_16 have eyes _ ) of such a pyramid of official personages
116_642_001_02_17 as those whose duty it was to prevent it .
116_642_001_02_18 Secondly , the neglect _ a neglect too indecorous
116_642_001_02_19 to have been manifested without cogent reasons _ the
116_642_001_02_20 compleat neglect shown to the only persons by whom
116_642_001_02_21 the smallest wish to see it remedied had ever been
116_642_001_02_22 manifested .
116_642_001_02_23 Thirdly , the total absence of all signs of dis-
116_642_001_02_24 -pleasure _ as well rewards the persons by whose im-
116_642_001_02_25 -mediate misconduct the mischief had been brought
116_642_001_02_26 about , as towards the perpetually silent and mo-
116_642_001_02_27 -tionless official spectators , by whose connivance it
116_642_001_02_28 had been fostered : _ or the contrary _
116_642_001_02_29 Fourthly , the positive tokens of satisfaction given ,
116_642_001_02_30 by resorting to these very patrons & protectors of the
116_642_001_02_31 abuse

115_007_004_02_02 -vision for old age , upon the plan of the Annuity Soci-

115_007_004_02_04 13th . To insure to them a livelihood at the expiration
115_007_004_02_05 of their terms : by setting up a subsidiary establish-
115_007_004_02_06 -ment into which all such as though proper should
115_007_004_02_07 be admitted , and in which they would be continued
115_007_004_02_08 in the exercise of the trades in which they were em-
115_007_004_02_09 -ployed during their confinement without any far-
115_007_004_02_10 -ther expence to Government
115_007_004_02_11 14 . To make himself personally responsible for the
115_007_004_02_12 reformatory efficacy of his management , and even
115_007_004_02_13 make amends in most instances for any accident
115_007_004_02_14 of its failure , by paying a sum of money for every
115_007_004_02_15 prisoner convicted of a felony after his discharge ,
115_007_004_02_16 at a rate increasing according to the number of years
115_007_004_02_17 he had been under the proposer ' s care : viz : a sum
115_007_004_02_18 not exceeding £10 if the prisoner had been in the
115_007_004_02_19 Penitentiary Panopticon two years : not exceeding £15
115_007_004_02_20 if 3 years : not exceeding £20 if 4 years : not exceeding
115_007_004_02_21 £25 if 5 years or upwards : such seem to be paid im-
115_007_004_02_22 -mediately on conviction , and to be applied to the in-
115_007_004_02_23 -demnification of the persons injured by such subse-
115_007_004_02_24 -quent offence , and to be equal in amount to the value
115_007_004_02_25 of the injury , so long as it did not exceed the sums
115_007_004_02_26 respectively above specified

096_024_001_02_02 Review for our Author ' s Argu=
096_024_001_02_03 ments .
096_024_001_02_04 Before we proceed to examine our author ' s
096_024_001_02_05 account of municipal law , it may be proper
096_024_001_02_06 to stop a moment , and take a review of the _
096_024_001_02_07 arguments he has advanced , and the princi-
096_024_001_02_08 -ples he has laid down in the preceding part
096_024_001_02_09 of his introduction .
096_024_001_02_10 Our author sets out by defining law
096_024_001_02_11 to be a rule of conduct presented
096_024_001_02_12 & while the
096_024_001_02_13 by a superior , Law therefo inferior
096_024_001_02_14 is bound to obey . According to this
096_024_001_02_15 definition Law must be something
096_024_001_02_16 obvious to ourselves , declared &
096_024_001_02_17 notified thus in a manner
096_024_001_02_18 perceptible to our selves . It
096_024_001_02_19 must likewise be addressed to beings
096_024_001_02_20 who have a power of asking or

072_103_001_04_01 Punishment
072_103_001_04_02 If any one commit Theft his punishment shall be
072_103_001_04_03 as follows :
072_103_001_04_04 1 . He shall be made to do Penance more or less public.x
072_103_001_04_05 [ 2 . He may be made to suffer penitential Imprisonment for
072_103_001_04_06 not less than one week nor more than four . + + ]
072_103_001_04_07 3 . He shall be confined to hard Labour for a quarter of a
072_103_001_04_08 ( a )
072_103_001_04_09 year ; and besides that for the space of a day for every [ sixpence ] of
072_103_001_04_10 the Value of the thing stolen . +

072_103_001_05_03 that therefore the enumeration above given is exhaustive .
072_103_001_05_04 [ ( a ) Sixpence ] The sum will of course require to be different accord=
072_103_001_05_05 : ing to the different values of money in different countries . The rule might
072_103_001_05_06 be that it should amount to half a day ' s Wages according to the ordi=
072_103_001_05_07 : nary price of labour . On this plan a man of the lowest Class which is the
072_103_001_05_08 Class to which the greater part of thieves will belong will be made to work

071_182_001_04_01 upon a bad halfpenny : but then the difficulty of putting
071_182_001_04_02 off a base Shilling may be Twenty four times as great ( or
071_182_001_04_03 perhaps more ) as the difficulty of getting off a bad half-pen=

071_182_001_04_05 Another thing is , that in proportion as the Coin is of the

071_182_001_05_02 ( a ) In England so little difficulty is made about the Copper Coin ;
071_182_001_05_03 that bad half-pence are often taken knowingly , even when good ones
071_182_001_05_04 are in plenty . Bad shillings , it is true , are also taken knowingly :
071_182_001_05_05 but then it is because there are scarce any good ones to be had :
071_182_001_05_06 and such bad ones as are most current are not in any way
071_182_001_05_07 great degree inferior to good ones . But neither in England nor
071_182_001_05_08 any where else will a man take any Gold coin which he sus=
071_182_001_05_09 : pects to be counterfeit or materially diminished . A piece of Gold
071_182_001_05_10 Coin is of course examined with much more attention than a
071_182_001_05_11 piece of Silver coin : as a piece of Silver Coin is with more
071_182_001_05_12 attention than a piece of Copper Coin . In England especially since
071_182_001_05_13 the reformation of the Gold Coin a man seldom takes a Guinea
071_182_001_05_14 or a half Guinea of a stranger without weighing it ; but a man
071_182_001_05_15 never thinks of weighing , and very seldom of submitting to any other
071_182_001_05_16 test a piece of Silver Coin .

071_165_003_04_11 be appropriated to the Coinage , and it might be made penal

071_165_003_05_02 ( a ) If any Legislator should think proper to pursue this idea and
071_165_003_05_03 prohibit any metallic composition in order to guard against its being
071_165_003_05_04 to be
071_165_003_05_05 thus abused it is hoped he will be a little more careful in the descrip=

071_165_003_05_07 [ 8 and 9 Will . 3 . C . ' 26 S . 6 and 9 ] took upon him to prohibit un=

096_099_004_01_02 which he is amerced goes to the State and therefore is not
096_099_004_01_03 lost : The Absurdity of such a proposition provision
096_099_004_01_04 will therefore appear still stronger & more unquestionable
096_099_004_01_05 if instead of the Fine we take for the Punishment any
096_099_004_01_06 Number of Stripes , no Matter what , which any one
096_099_004_01_07 may suppose equivalent to it . _ I made choice in

072_101_004_04_02 is not customary for the occupier of the land to make a profit

072_101_004_04_05 But this presumption may be defeated by any Act or Prac :
072_101_004_04_06 tice which shews that the owner meant not to give such per :

072_101_004_04_12 But this presumption may be defeated by particular
072_101_004_04_13 circumstances ; as if the thing taken be a Bank Note ; and he who
072_101_004_04_14 takes it ( a Servant suppose ) cannot read and knows not the

096_053_004_03_02 might be thought liable to err from ; or rules unerred from ? rules that
096_053_004_03_03 the creatures they are given to do not err from . rules that do not them-
096_053_004_03_04 -selves err from any thing , or rules that nothing errs from .
096_053_004_03_05 If the rules he means , are rules that do not err themselves , what it
096_053_004_03_06 is , supposing for argument sake they did err , what is it he ima-
096_053_004_03_07 gines they would err from ? If rules that the creatures do not err
096_053_004_03_08 from , whither he is absolutely sure that he could find or imagine
096_053_004_03_09 ( for it would be too hard upon him to require him to produce , any
096_053_004_03_10 such rule ? or whether if he found by chance a creature erring from
096_053_004_03_11 one of these his rules , he would not make another rule to suit the
096_053_004_03_12 erring ? and whither he would not find out the same sort of rules
096_053_004_03_13 for creatures if there were any such , that have chance to govern
096_053_004_03_14 them .
096_053_004_03_15 These questions , I say would need to be pursued to an answer , ere
096_053_004_03_16 we could say we understood our Author : they would need to be pur-

096_098_004_01_03 are more numerous than those of disobedience ,
096_098_004_01_04 & those of disobedience unpunished less so than
096_098_004_01_05 those of disobedience punished . But the propor-

071_156_002_03_01 Of Simple Mercantile Defraudment .
071_156_002_04_01 With mercantile Frauds the Case is different . Of the
071_156_002_04_02 persons concerned in those Offences some , indeed a great
071_156_002_04_03 number , probably the greater number , will be persons poss :
071_156_002_04_04 : essed of a very small degree of responsibility : but a consi :
071_156_002_04_05 : derable number will also be perfectly responsible : for against
071_156_002_04_06 the temptation of fraud no rank of Traders is absolutely
071_156_002_04_07 proof : and in the class of Traders are included persons of
071_156_002_04_08 all degrees of responsibility from the very lowest to the
071_156_002_04_09 very highest . On this account it seems improper to subject
071_156_002_04_10 offenders of the highest rank , at all events , to such a degree
071_156_002_04_11 of punishment , as those only of the lowest stand in need of .
071_156_002_04_12 At the same time in mercantile frauds the improbity
071_156_002_04_13 of intention is apt perhaps to be not quite so palpable as
071_156_002_04_14 in theft ; and what perhaps is more to the purpose the
071_156_002_04_15 rank and figure and reputation of the persons who are
071_156_002_04_16 sometimes betrayed into offences of this kind serve in
071_156_002_04_17 some degree to mitigate the natural infamy . It might on
071_156_002_04_18 this account seem harsh and unpopular to subject them at
071_156_002_04_19 all events to the same degree of factitious legal infamy .
071_156_002_04_20 With
115_075_004_01_01 14
115_075_004_02_01 granted , by the Court before whom such conviction shall have
115_075_004_02_02 taken place . Provided that if one such felon shall so have
115_075_004_02_03 been convicted of divers felonies , the sums payable on account
115_075_004_02_04 thereof shall not in the whole exceed the several utmost sums
115_075_004_02_05 respectively above limited .
115_075_004_02_06 Art.21 . To keep the management of the said intended
115_075_004_02_07 Penitentiary Establishment the more constantly and effectually
115_075_004_02_08 under the eye of Justice , it is hereby also agreed that the said first
115_075_004_02_09 intended Governor and his said Successors shall on the first
115_075_004_02_10 day of every term by themselves respectively or their sufficient
115_075_004_02_11 Deputy present to the Court of King ' s Bench a Report , exhibiting
115_075_004_02_12 in detail the whole state , moral and medical of the establishment :
115_075_004_02_13 together with the economical state thereof , at least in so far as
115_075_004_02_14 the Public on behalf of the Prisoners is interested therein : and
115_075_004_02_15 moreover that they shall also by such deputy or if thereto ordered
115_075_004_02_16 or required by the Court in person , then and there , as well as on any
115_075_004_02_17 other day or days on summons from the Court or in Vacation time
115_075_004_02_18 from any Judge thereof , full true and perfect answer make to all
115_075_004_02_19 such questions as shall be put to them in relation thereto , not only
115_075_004_02_20 on the part of the Court or Officer of the Crown , but by leave
115_075_004_02_21 of the Court on the part of any other person whatsoever .
115_075_004_02_22 Art.22 . And Whereas by a Report made to the Honour-
115_075_004_02_23 -able the House of Commons by a Committee of the said House ,
115_075_004_02_24 and dated the 22nd day of March 1784 it appears that according
115_075_004_02_25 to the first estimates made by Mess : rs Blackburn & Hardwick

115_075_004_02_28 by the Statute of the 19th of his Majesty Chapter 74 , the
115_075_004_02_29 same would have amounted to the sum of £210,352 , making

116_294_001_02_01 N . S . Wales
116_294_001_03_01 According to the account given by Captain Collins in the
116_294_001_03_02 same paragraph , at the very time of giving this assurance , the
116_294_001_03_03 intention was that it should not be fulfilled . For now it was
116_294_001_03_04 that " it was understood " ( now for the first time , as already observed )
116_294_001_03_05 " that a clause was to be inserted in all future contracts for
116_294_001_03_06 " shipping for this country , subjecting the masters to certain
116_294_001_03_07 " penalties , on certificates being received of their having brought
116_294_001_03_08 " away any Convicts or other persons from the settlement without
116_294_001_03_09 " the Governor ' s permission : and as it was not probable that many
116_294_001_03_10 " of them would , on their return , refrain from the vices , or avoid
116_294_001_03_11 " the society , of those companions who had been the causes of their
116_294_001_03_12 " transportation to this country , not many could hope to obtain the
116_294_001_03_13 " sanction of the governor for their return " . _ A promise was thus
116_294_001_03_14 given to all - and this at the very time when it was understood _
116_294_001_03_15 understood , not by those who received it , but only by those who
116_294_001_03_16 gave it , that " not many " would ever receive the benefit of it . _
116_294_001_03_17 No wonder : since in the bosom of the Governor there was this
116_294_001_03_18 are
116_294_001_03_19 dilemma for every one : _ you a bad man ? _ you would do mis-
116_294_001_03_20 -chief elsewhere : are you a good man ? _ we can ' t spare you . It
116_294_001_03_21 was by this last horn of the syllogism , that Bloodsworth was
116_294_001_03_22 hung up _ the good Convict mentioned in No..3 . " As his loss
116_294_001_03_23 " would be severely felt should he quit it " ( the Colony ) " while in
116_294_001_03_24 hi " its infancy " therefore it was that he received what is
116_294_001_03_25 called his freedom _ viz : an obligation to work for two years ,
116_294_001_03_26 having for his recompence the not being starved . _
116_294_001_03_27 To say nothing of the perfidy _ the wanton useless perfidy _
116_294_001_03_28 there is in this business a sort of inconsistency which to me
116_294_001_03_29 is most perfectly inexplicable . If guided by his own untutored &
116_294_001_03_30 uncorrupted sense of justice , the Governor had set out with this
116_294_001_03_31 exhilerating

073_001_001_02_05 I am a Country Clergyman _ I wish to
073_001_001_02_06 have some Acquaintance with the Laws under which
073_001_001_02_07 quarters of
073_001_001_02_08 I live . I hear from all with whom I converse that that there
073_001_001_02_09 is a Book by the Help of which I may compass it
073_001_001_02_10 with a pleasure which can only be surpassed by
073_001_001_02_11 the Solidity of the Instruction . I ask whether I may
073_001_001_02_12 lay my Account with understanding it ? For Law-
073_001_001_02_13 -yers having by Dint of Toil arrived at the Understand-
073_001_001_02_14 -ing of the Current Language of their Profession , are
073_001_001_02_15 too apt to suppose the same of others , who have
073_001_001_02_16 had something else to mind . I am answered in
073_001_001_02_17 the work being
073_001_001_02_18 the affirmative ; for that it was peculiarly calculated
073_001_001_02_19 for the Instruction of such Persons as have no more
073_001_001_02_20 than that share of preliminary Knowledge which
073_001_001_02_21 I am told
073_001_001_02_22 I flatter myself to possess . It contains not indeed , the
073_001_001_02_23 whole Law _ for of this there are but 4 Volumes and of
073_001_001_02_24 that

071_141_001_04_01 Incendiarism is where [ without law-
071_141_001_04_02 : : ful cause ] a man is concerned in kindling Fire ,
071_141_001_04_03 intending thereby to endanger the life or damage
071_141_001_04_04 the property of another to the amount of [ £ 3.100 ]
071_141_001_04_05 having no right ( A ) so to do , and knowing that he hath
071_141_001_04_06 none .
071_141_001_04_07 [ ( A ) Right ] Justifications are 1
071_141_001_04_08 Consent ; provided it be of all parties who
071_141_001_04_09 appear to be concerned ; for instance if it be a
071_141_001_04_10 lone house that is endangered , all persons who
071_141_001_04_11 appear to have an interest in the house or such
071_141_001_04_12 of its contents as are damageable by fire ; if
071_141_001_04_13 it be a house in a town all persons who
071_141_001_04_14 appear to have an interest [ in any house ]
071_141_001_04_15 in the Town . See Tit : Justifications .

073_056_001_03_01 Further consideration of it to a subsequent chapter
073_056_001_03_02 appropriated to that title .
073_056_001_03_03 To return therefore to
073_056_001_03_04 Theft
073_056_001_03_05 And first as to the taking It may be
073_056_001_03_06 a Question , by whom is it to be determined , in every
073_056_001_03_07 again
073_056_001_03_08 Case , whether this has or has not happened ? and secondly
073_056_001_03_09 whether by their own naked Discretion pro re nata or
073_056_001_03_10 with any preestablished Rules for their Assistance ?
073_056_001_03_11 to the first
073_056_001_03_12 I answer by no means by the judge . lest least we
073_056_001_03_13 should have a taking which no common Man
073_056_001_03_14 would deem such , as we have already a Breaking
073_056_001_03_15 where nothing is broken and an Entry where nobody
073_056_001_03_16 has got in
073_056_001_03_17 involves
073_056_001_03_18 Thise point here to be decided involves no collateral
073_056_001_03_19 Point of Law , the Question being merely whether that
073_056_001_03_20 which a common Man would deem a taking has
073_056_001_03_21 been done ?
073_056_001_03_22 The misfortune is that with regard to this , there
073_056_001_03_23 will be differences of opinion : but either their Differences
073_056_001_03_24 are reconcileable by Rules intelligible to those about
073_056_001_03_25 to
071_139_004_01_01 C
071_139_004_02_01 12
071_139_004_03_01 Destruction or Endamagement .
071_139_004_03_02 Of obstinate waster or usurpation .
071_139_004_04_01 would not part with it for a hundred pound .
071_139_004_04_02 Your adversary knowing this gets possession of
071_139_004_04_03 the ring and destroys it . For according to the rule
071_139_004_04_04 of judging which his malevolence suggests to him
071_139_004_04_05 it may be very well worth his while to pay
071_139_004_04_06 a guinea for the pleasure of exposing You to
071_139_004_04_07 so great a mortification . If the case is that he
071_139_004_04_08 sets the same ideal value on the ring that You
071_139_004_04_09 do , the person for instance whose hair is in it
071_139_004_04_10 having been beloved by him as well as by You ,
071_139_004_04_11 so that instead of damaging or destroying it
071_139_004_04_12 in such case
071_139_004_04_13 he means to keep it , as an additional mo=
071_139_004_04_14 : tive to the above pleasure of malevolence ,
071_139_004_04_15 he will have the pleasure of possessing the
071_139_004_04_16 thing on which he sets so high a value .
071_139_004_04_17 It is plain therefore that a punishment
071_139_004_04_18 must be capable of being rendered very severe :
071_139_004_04_19 in order to be able to surmount in all cases
071_139_004_04_20 liable
071_139_004_04_21 the force of incitements which are apt to be so
071_139_004_04_22 powerful .
071_139_004_04_23 2 . It may be observed too that this offence
071_139_004_04_24 approaches

073_002_001_02_01 disposed
073_002_001_02_02 were I even used to search , could I expect to find
073_002_001_02_03 any Lawyer to consult of equal , not to say superior ,
073_002_001_02_04 Reputation ? My Neighbour ' s Interest for my Money
073_002_001_02_05 is as good as any body ' s else , why should not I
073_002_001_02_06 let him have it ? All this while this Fortune
073_002_001_02_07 to which I trusted had been every penny of it settled
073_002_001_02_08 upon the Wife to her separate Use for her Life ,
073_002_001_02_09 with power to dispose of it by will _ she has exe-
073_002_001_02_10 ecuted that Power in Favor of John Miles : my
073_002_001_02_11 Neighbour the Widower who was not worth a Groat
073_002_001_02_12 makes himself very merry with my £200 and
073_002_001_02_13 I hear no more of him . Much Consolation
073_002_001_02_14 does it give me when my Money ' s gone to be
073_002_001_02_15 told , that the Instruction is right tho ' I am
073_002_001_02_16 ruined by the following of it : and tho ' what is
073_002_001_02_17 there said is in Effect false , yet with a mental
073_002_001_02_18 Reservation it is also true . I then begin to ask
073_002_001_02_19 whether all the Truths in these Lectures are of that
073_002_001_02_20 Sort ? and if some are , how am I to know whether
073_002_001_02_21 any other which I may pitch upon is not of the
073_002_001_02_22 Number ? how am I to distinguish those which
073_002_001_02_23 ruin me if I believe them , for those which I
073_002_001_02_24 may
027_029_001_01_01 Happ : ss and Unhapp.ss Value of a Pain or Pleasure ( 1
027_029_001_02_01 1 .
027_029_001_02_02 1 . Of whatever nature a Pleasure be ; a pleasure of the Body , or a Plea-
027_029_001_02_03 sure of the Mind ; a pleasure of enjoyment , a pleasure of possession ,
027_029_001_02_04 or a pleasure of Expectation ; a pleasure of the concupiscible appetites or
027_029_001_02_05 a pleasure of the irascible ; what we shall have to say of any pleasure
027_029_001_02_06 in the present chapter will be found equally to belong to all : and so
027_029_001_02_07 the same
027_029_001_02_08 it is with Pains .
027_029_001_02_09 2 .
027_029_001_02_10 A pleasure may be more or less intense : hence we come to speak of its in-
027_029_001_02_11 this
027_029_001_02_12 -tensity : when its intensity is at a high degree , we may ( preserving the same
027_029_001_02_13 or slight
027_029_001_02_14 expression ) that it is intenser when at a low degree we call it faint .
027_029_001_02_15 3 .
027_029_001_02_16 The time it lasts , is either long or short ; hence we have to speak of its _
027_029_001_02_17 duration .
027_029_001_02_18 4 .
027_029_001_02_19 This is the case with every thing that is called Pleasure : to exist it _
027_029_001_02_20 must possess two qualities : it must possess intensity ; it must possess Dura
027_029_001_02_21 -tion . They constantly belong to it ; they are essential to it : it cannot be con-
027_029_001_02_22 ceived without them .
027_029_001_02_23 5 .
027_029_001_02_24 Body , to exist , must in like manner possess three things : length , _
027_029_001_02_25 breadth and thickness . They constantly belong to it : it cannot be con-
027_029_001_02_26 ceived without them . Of them it is said in a certain sense to be compos ' d
027_029_001_02_27 Under them it is said to be comprised : By them it is measured . Mathe
027_029_001_02_28 maticians call them it ' s dimensions . Dimensions " comes from " Di-
027_029_001_02_29 mitior " . " dimitior " is " to measure " .
027_029_001_02_30 6 .
027_029_001_02_31 then begin with
027_029_001_02_32 Of Mathematicians let us borrow the appellation : and let us saying ;
027_029_001_02_33 Pleasure is comprised under two dimensions . Intensity and Dura

071_101_003_04_02 the case of the great bulk of the people . In this case the ap=
071_101_003_04_03 : parel and instruments of trade peculiar to each should re=

071_101_003_04_06 make an express allowance out of it to the Man .
071_101_003_04_07 Where the husband brought a capital into the com=
071_101_003_04_08 : mon stock , and the wife little or nothing , some allow=
071_101_003_04_09 : ance ought to be made to her .
071_101_003_04_10 Where the wife brought a capital into the common
071_101_003_04_11 stock , and the husband little or nothing , some allowance
071_101_003_04_12 ought to be made to her .
071_101_003_04_13 Upon the whole it ought to be so ordered , that the Wife
071_101_003_04_14 might exercise this right if she thought proper,upon terms
071_101_003_04_15 rather more advantageous to her than to the Husband .
071_101_003_04_16 For this purpose the Age of the parties is also to be
071_101_003_04_17 taken into consideration . If it is to be considered that by the
071_101_003_04_18 same length of cohabitation the power of pleasing the oppo=

071_146_003_05_05 two persons who play with dice is that neither
071_146_003_05_06 party shall use or has used any art to make
071_146_003_05_07 the dice turn up one way rather than another .

071_146_003_05_11 was to be paid only in case the dice turned
071_146_003_05_12 up in the way in question without the using
071_146_003_05_13 any such art to cause them so to do , or the
071_146_003_05_14 behaving in any other way as if no such arts
071_146_003_05_15 were employed is a tacit way of suggesting that

071_008_004_02_01 Of Excuses Extenuations
071_008_004_03_01 have occasioned a man by striking him ; and it appears that
071_008_004_03_02 you had no particular intention of striking him : but yet
071_008_004_03_03 that he was close to you ; insomuch that , had you but looked
071_008_004_03_04 round to observe whether any person was in the way , you
071_008_004_03_05 must have seen him ; it will appear that your striking him
071_008_004_03_06 was an act of heedlessness . But this will not appear to

072_066_001_04_02 that is he may act counter to his own interest in either of two
072_066_001_04_03 ways ; 1 . By parting with his property too fast , when
072_066_001_04_04 he has property , this is called Prodigality : or by omit :
072_066_001_04_05 : ting to get by industrious means what is necessary
072_066_001_04_06 for his support when he has none . This goes by the

116_068_001_02_02 " the settlers , has lately speared one of them , a marine settler
116_068_001_02_03 " ( as those were stiled who had former formerly belonged to the
116_068_001_02_04 " marine detachment ) at George ' s river , so effectually , that he died
116_068_001_02_05 " of his wounds . The natives belonged to the tribe of which
116_068_001_02_06 " Pemulwy was the leader . "
116_068_001_02_07 Pp 281,282,283 . " The natives having murdered two men who
116_068_001_02_08 " possessed farms at the Hawkesbury , some of the settlers in that
116_068_001_02_09 " district determined to revenge their death . There were at this
116_068_001_02_10 " time three native boys living with one Pavel , a settler , and two
116_068_001_02_11 " others , his neighbors . These unoffending lads they selected as the
116_068_001_02_12 " objects of their revenge ...... .
116_068_001_02_13 " The prisoners , in their defence , brought forward a crowd of
116_068_001_02_14 " witnesses to prove that a number of white people had at
116_068_001_02_15 " various times been killed by the natives ; but , could these peo-
116_068_001_02_16 - " ple have been sufficiently understood , proofs would not have
116_068_001_02_17 " been wanting on their side , of the wanton & barbarous manner
116_068_001_02_18 " in which many of them had been destroyed ...... .
116_068_001_02_19 " As it was impossible to explain to the natives , or cause
116_068_001_02_20 " them to comprehend the nature of these doubts , it was to be
116_068_001_02_21 " expected that they would ill brook the return of the prisoners
116_068_001_02_22 " to their farms and occupations , without having received some
116_068_001_02_23 punishment : a circumstance wholly inconsistent with their
116_068_001_02_24 " own ideas and customs ; and , indeed , they loudly threatened
116_068_001_02_25 " to burn the crops as soon as it could be effected . Fire , in
116_068_001_02_26 " the hands of a body of a irritated and hostile natives ,
116_068_001_02_27 " might , with but little trouble to them , ruin the prospect

116_068_001_02_29 " that they were not ignorant of having this power in their
116_068_001_02_30 " hands ; it was , therefore , certainly very essential to the comfort

115_111_002_02_03 acceded to : not a syllable , so much as hinted , about
115_111_002_02_04 refunding any part of the money : Mr Bentham ' s
115_111_002_02_05 having the Land in Fee Simple was incompatible
115_111_002_02_06 with it . Afterwards it appeared that before the
115_111_002_02_07 Proposal had been given in , the expence of the
115_111_002_02_08 Hulk Plan had been reduced to £21,000 : but the
115_111_002_02_09 demand of the £27,000 having been made and acceded
115_111_002_02_10 to , the reduction made no difference with regard
115_111_002_02_11 to Mr Bentham ' s treaty , nor was any notice
115_111_002_02_12 ever taken of it . Had the Hulk price been
115_111_002_02_13 what the only documents then public shewed it
115_111_002_02_14 to be , Government would have got an annuity of
115_111_002_02_15 £9000 a year for nothing : to say nothing of the
115_111_002_02_16 many other advantages to the public , most of them
115_111_002_02_17 attended with correspondent burthens to Mr Ben-
115_111_002_02_18 -tham . As it was , they had £6000 to pay for this
115_111_002_02_19 annuity of £9000 . ( £6000 being the difference
115_111_002_02_20 betwixt the £27,000 and the £21,000 . ) Such is
115_111_002_02_21 the hardship to Government . Suppose the Annuity
115_111_002_02_22 to be postponed for two years instead of one , then
115_111_002_02_23 the bargain is still more advantageous to Government ,
115_111_002_02_24 than if it had obtained gratis an annuity to the
115_111_002_02_25 same amount , but of that retarded commencement .
115_111_002_02_26 It was on this latter basis that Mr Bentham

116_074_001_02_11 " the losses which they represented , and they must be sensible he
116_074_001_02_12 " had used every means in his power to remove and relieve
116_074_001_02_13 " their misfortunes , yet his duty to government compelled him
116_074_001_02_14 " to adhere to the reduction of which they complained . At the same
116_074_001_02_15 " time he could not avoid observing , that some of these misfortunes
116_074_001_02_16 " had in many instances proceeded from a want of that attention
116_074_001_02_17 " to their own interest , which every man possessing common dis-
116_074_001_02_18 - " cretion would have shewn ; many of them having parted with
116_074_001_02_19 " their last bushel for the gratification of the moment , thereby re-
116_074_001_02_20 -ducing their families to distress and nakedness .
116_074_001_02_21 " He likewise informed them , that he had much pleasure
116_074_001_02_22 " in finding that government had a serious intention , as early
116_074_001_02_23 " as the public concerns of the nation would admit , of adminis-
116_074_001_02_24 - " tering every possible relief , by supplying the inhabitants with
116_074_001_02_25 " such necessaries and comforts as they might require at a moderate
116_074_001_02_26 " price . He was , however , obliged to direct the commissary to
116_074_001_02_27 " receive the grain of this season at the prices ordered by him
116_074_001_02_28 " in the month of October . " _

116_074_001_02_30 " total inability to bear any reduction in the price of the wheat of this season ,
116_074_001_02_31 " on account , not only of their former heavy losses , but of the exorbitant prices of
116_074_001_02_32 " all those necessaries of life which they required for paying their labourers , the
116_074_001_02_33 " governor consented to receive the wheat only at the former price of ten

071_180_004_03_01 Of Frauds relative to the Coin .
071_180_004_04_01 at first sight that where a man counterfeits foreign Coin , the
071_180_004_04_02 loss is not to his own country , but to that to which the Coin pur=
071_180_004_04_03 : ports to belong . but this is not necessarily the case . The loss
071_180_004_04_04 is even more likely to fall upon the people of his own country ,
071_180_004_04_05 than upon any person abroad . There is no Coin of any Country , but
071_180_004_04_06 what some person or other of every Country may have some
071_180_004_04_07 occasion to purchase . If then a Man in England , for example ,
071_180_004_04_08 counterfeits French money it is probably in a view of exchang=
071_180_004_04_09 : ing it in England for English money with some person who
071_180_004_04_10 wants money to spend in France .
071_180_004_04_11 Besides this it is for the reciprocal advantage of all
071_180_004_04_12 nations that the protection which every state affords to its own
071_180_004_04_13 subjects should be extended , where it is wanted , to the indivi=
071_180_004_04_14 : duals of every other . The case even of a war between the two
071_180_004_04_15 states makes no difference ; for howsoever the happiness of a na=
071_180_004_04_16 : tion one is at war with may be impaired yet the strength of
071_180_004_04_17 it is not in any sensible degree diminished nor consequently

072_047_002_04_02 character of an enemy to the foreign state , the bringing on

072_047_002_04_04 not the purpose , at any rate not the declared purpose of

072_047_002_04_06 It is however the pretty certain consequence ; unless
072_047_002_04_07 his own State disavows his conduct , and as a proof of such
072_047_002_04_08 disavowal , in some cases punishes him , in as far as it lies

072_047_002_04_13 of benevolence ) to punish offences committed by its own
072_047_002_04_14 members against those of any other state .
072_047_002_04_15 As to acts
072_047_002_04_16 All which are inimical to a foreign state they
072_047_002_04_17 may be either such as affect any individual members of
072_047_002_04_18 the State in their private capacity ; or 2.ly The State itself

072_169_002_04_03 in threatning to do an injury to that other the intention of
072_169_002_04_04 your adversary was to expose You to contempt : as if the
072_169_002_04_05 person so threatned were any near relation or friend or
072_169_002_04_06 dependent of Yours , especially if the party insulted be

072_169_002_04_09 Reasons .
072_169_002_04_10 For the case may be that you might be as much
072_169_002_04_11 affected by an injury , especially by a personal insult , done
072_169_002_04_12 to a person so related to You , as by an injury done to
072_169_002_04_13 Yourself : and such an injury if offered with impunity ,
072_169_002_04_14 might in either case serve equally to display your Helpless :

072_169_002_04_19 For insulting Threats the Punishment shall be

073_071_003_03_09 that of " Lucri Causa " + which has a meaning

116_643_002_02_01 least _ not to speak of other bars _ circumstantial
116_643_002_02_02 evidence is not altogether without its weight . As to

116_643_002_02_17 I say to expose himself : but to shew how compleat

072_051_002_03_01 Offences against the external Security of the State .
072_051_002_04_01 common case of this sort is where a subject of one ' s own
072_051_002_04_02 state furnishes military stores to the enemies or revolted sub=
072_051_002_04_03 : jects of the foreign state . This is the most common case , because
072_051_002_04_04 the gain to be made by such a traffic is a motive that is more
072_051_002_04_05 apt to be in people ' s way than any which could lead a man
072_051_002_04_06 to prejudice a foreign state in any other manner . It is
072_051_002_04_07 however
072_051_002_04_08 also not an uncommon case for a subject of one ' s own
072_051_002_04_09 state to enlist himself or to engage others to enlist in the
072_051_002_04_10 military service of the enemies or revolted subjects of a
072_051_002_04_11 two
072_051_002_04_12 foreign state . These cases are the most common ; but there
072_051_002_04_13 are few of the acts that can be committed to the preju=
072_051_002_04_14 : dice of one ' s own State but may also be committed to
072_051_002_04_15 the prejudice of a foreign state .
072_051_002_04_16 countenance or discountenance
072_051_002_04_17 The degree of contenance or discontenance which
072_051_002_04_18 it may be proper to give to such acts will depend altogether
072_051_002_04_19 upon the particular connections between the several states
072_051_002_04_20 that may be concerned . It is impossible therefore to as :
072_051_002_04_21 : certain it by the letter of any universal Law . It will depend
072_051_002_04_22 partly upon the reason that one ' s own state may have for
072_051_002_04_23 partly
072_051_002_04_24 wishing well to the foreign one : that is , upon what it may
072_051_002_04_25 have to hope from the foreign : partly upon what it may

072_032_002_03_01 Of Offences against Reputation in general
072_032_002_04_01 before his face ; and therefore ought to be more severely
072_032_002_04_02 punished .
072_032_002_04_03 Reasons .
072_032_002_04_04 Defamation , it is true , is rather more likely to pro=
072_032_002_04_05 : duce quarrels when delivered before a man ' s face than
072_032_002_04_06 when behind his back ; particularly in proportion as it is
072_032_002_04_07 accompanied by reproach : and this produces at any rate
072_032_002_04_08 a present pain . But then on the other hand this is all
072_032_002_04_09 the mischief it is likely to produce . A man in this
072_032_002_04_10 case has the Opportunity of defending his Reputation
072_032_002_04_11 the instant it is in danger . It is not absolutely certain
072_032_002_04_12 indeed that his defence even in this case will be suc=
072_032_002_04_13 : cessful ; it is not certain that he will be able to clear
072_032_002_04_14 himself of the imputation : it is however most probable :
072_032_002_04_15 since by the supposition he defends himself with all
072_032_002_04_16 the advantage which truth has over falsehood . When

116_627_001_03_04 disposition as that of promoting the object of the Act ? -
116_627_001_03_05 I mean , my Lord , the Act which was calling upon him

116_627_001_03_12 It is in pursuance of this plan , my Lord , that a

116_627_001_03_14 March 1800 , the Treasury , on the ground of a preparatory
116_627_001_03_15 Letter therein spoken of as received from his Grace , write
116_627_001_03_16 to me to acquaint me that the " proposed building of
116_627_001_03_17 " a Panopticon was to be calculated to accommodate 2000

116_627_001_03_19 of mine , written of on the 17th of August more than seven
116_627_001_03_20 months before , in the declared view of my making
116_627_001_03_21 preparations of an expensive nature , and begging to know
116_627_001_03_22 for what number they were to be made . Faithful to
116_627_001_03_23 this same plan while I was amusing myself with
116_627_001_03_24 these preparations , together with other occupations

096_021_003_02_03 look for these laws of nations , if so they
096_021_003_02_04 must be called . " They depend entirely ( says
096_021_003_02_05 " our author ) upon the rules of natural law ,

115_112_002_02_03 injurious to the principle .
115_112_002_02_04 In this view he proposes the article to stand

115_112_002_02_06 Article.7 . Each Prisoner shall be supplied every
115_112_002_02_07 day with wholesome food : viz : bread , interchangeable
115_112_002_02_08 with rice , pease , potatoes , or other roots commonly
115_112_002_02_09 used for human food , or with messes made of oat-
115_112_002_02_10 -meal or other meal , or grain commonly used for
115_112_002_02_11 human food , as much as he shall choose to eat ;
115_112_002_02_12 together with a competent allowance of meat , or
115_112_002_02_13 fish , or soups , or other messes made of any such
115_112_002_02_14 animals and parts of animals as are usually em-
115_112_002_02_15 -ployed for human food : which said allowance of
115_112_002_02_16 meat or the equivalent thereof as aforesaid shall
115_112_002_02_17 also be made in like manner without stint to every
115_112_002_02_18 man who shall be employed in work , and who
115_112_002_02_19 shall exert himself with ordinary diligence in the
115_112_002_02_20 execution of the same : but in case of idleness or
115_112_002_02_21 misbehaviour the quantity of such meat or succe-

071_035_002_05_01 Extortion in an officer is where a person in office being
071_035_002_05_02 bound to render a certain service to another in a certain occasion
071_035_002_05_03 in virtue of his office , gives the party to understand that he
071_035_002_05_04 will not perform such service unless such a fee be given him

071_035_002_06_02 [ ( D ) Due ] A lawful fee is where the quantum of it is Setled by Law
071_035_002_06_03 is what is appointed by the Law .

071_035_002_06_06 Where the quantum is not determinable by custom , for

071_035_002_06_08 to wit
071_035_002_06_09 trouble of the officer appears to be fairly worth : in the opinion
071_035_002_06_10 of the Judge before whom the prosecution for extortion

115_107_002_01_01 The publicity which for the benefit of the service
115_107_002_01_02 the intended first Governor is so anxious to establish
115_107_002_01_03 must of course be attended with the personal inconven-
115_107_002_01_04 -ience of exposing his management to a
115_107_002_01_05 proportionable multitude of complaints . Innocence
115_107_002_01_06 will be a sufficient protection against specific charges :
115_107_002_01_07 but against superficial prejudices & vague imputations
115_107_002_01_08 it will be a matter of no small use & comfort to
115_107_002_01_09 him to be provided with a short answer such as
115_107_002_01_10 the provision in question and nothing else can
115_107_002_01_11 enable him to give .
115_107_002_01_12 II . On the ground of precedent _
115_107_002_01_13 By the Slave Trade Act of the last Session ,
115_107_002_01_14 premiums are given as well to the Master as to the
115_107_002_01_15 Surgeon of Slave Ships for the purpose of ensuring
115_107_002_01_16 the good treatment of the Slaves during the voyage :
115_107_002_01_17 if no more deaths than 2 , to the Master £100 , to
115_107_002_01_18 the Surgeon £50 : if no more than 3 , to the Master
115_107_002_01_19 £50 , to the Surgeon £25 : and though the trade is a
115_107_002_01_20 trade carried on on the account of individuals , the
115_107_002_01_21 allowance is at the expence of Government .
115_107_002_01_22 The same principle has lately been applied by
115_107_002_01_23 Administration of its own accord to the very case of
115_107_002_01_24 Convicts for the purpose of ensuring good treatment
115_107_002_01_25 to them during their voyage to the place of

071_163_002_04_02 1 . If among the instruments necessary for making Coin
071_163_002_04_03 in a particular manner there be any which are not necessa=
071_163_002_04_04 =ry for the purpose of any other Art , the use and possession
071_163_002_04_05 of all such instruments may be prohibited ( giving proper no=
071_163_002_04_06 : tice ) under the same penalties as the entire process of fabri=
071_163_002_04_07 : cation .
071_163_002_04_08 2 . If there be any instruments necessary for the making of
071_163_002_04_09 the above mentioned instruments and which are not necessary for
071_163_002_04_10 any other Art , such instruments may be prohibited in like

071_163_002_04_16 trifling utility
071_163_002_04_17 3 . If such other Art be of trivial use it might be worth while
071_163_002_04_18 to make a sacrifice of it to the security of the Coinage and to
071_163_002_04_19 prohibit it altogether .

072_031_001_03_13 In settling the Law relative to this and the preceding

072_031_001_03_15 hand the leaving the reputation of an innocent man in
072_031_001_03_16 any respect at the mercy of his enemy ; on the other hand the

072_031_001_03_21 Reproach
115_107_003_01_01 The date of Mr Bentham ' s Proposal of which the
115_107_003_01_02 article in question forms a part , is considerably prior
115_107_003_01_03 to the application made of it in both those instances .
115_107_003_01_04 Seeing it universally approved and applauded in these
115_107_003_01_05 instances it would be matter of no small mortification
115_107_003_01_06 to him to find it rejected in an instance in which at
115_107_003_01_07 his own risk he has shewn so much anxiety to see it
115_107_003_01_08 introduced . Should the Inventor of this species of
115_107_003_01_09 security be debarred the faculty of purchasing for
115_107_003_01_10 valuable consideration a premium which so many
115_107_003_01_11 others in similar situations are called upon to receive
115_107_003_01_12 gratis , it would be a modern instance of the Sic vos
115_107_003_01_13 non vobis , and surely rather an extraordinary one .
115_107_003_01_14 Will it be seriously apprehended that under the
115_107_003_01_15 influence of such a preservative Prisoners may not
115_107_003_01_16 die fast enough in the Prison ? Should no mortal
115_107_003_01_17 ever die there Government know the worst : two or three
115_107_003_01_18 thousand a year is not too much to pay for a receipt
115_107_003_01_19 for immortality .

071_185_001_04_05 is its tendency to distribute itself into small parcels and

072_167_003_04_04 of unlawful Homicide , as the case may happen ; if it be intended
072_167_003_04_05 only and not occasioned , it constitutes an attempt referable to one
072_167_003_04_06 or other of these offences . If any farther mischief that is not per :

116_606_001_03_01 increase has had one or more of three objects : _ pre-
116_606_001_03_02 -vention of disease _ affording working room _ affording
116_606_001_03_03 means of separation for Convicts of different descriptions :
116_606_001_03_04 sequestration in various degrees of perfection , up to
116_606_001_03_05 the pinnacle of penal luxury _ total solitude . _
116_606_001_03_06 Space for prevention of disease is a most indis-
116_606_001_03_07 -putable improvement , wherever necessary , but an
116_606_001_03_08 improvement that has no particular reference to
116_606_001_03_09 penitentiary discipline . Of this salutary discipline ,
116_606_001_03_10 space for separation , space for working , may be
116_606_001_03_11 stated as to the two characteristic features , so
116_606_001_03_12 far as architecture is concerned . _
116_606_001_03_13 In the increase of space for separation ,
116_606_001_03_14 reformation , or rather non _ increase ofor corruption ,
116_606_001_03_15 was the object aimed at . This object will have
116_606_001_03_16 been compassed in a greater or less degree of per-
116_606_001_03_17 -fection according to the sufficiency of the architec-
116_606_001_03_18 -tural means , and the use made of them in the
116_606_001_03_19 management . As far as my opportunities of ob-
116_606_001_03_20 -servation extended _ and the enquiry was once
116_606_001_03_21 an object to me _ one great obstacle to this end
116_606_001_03_22 appears to apply in common , and with scarce
116_606_001_03_23 any exception that I could observe , to all these
116_606_001_03_24 prisons : I mean the want of compleatness in
116_606_001_03_25 the plan of separation . What matters it whether
116_606_001_03_26 there be certain times of the day in which the
116_606_001_03_27 raw are debarred from getting instruction from
116_606_001_03_28 the reprobate , if there are others in which they are
116_606_001_03_29 brought together ? In the department of wholesome
116_606_001_03_30 instruction

115_110_003_02_01 upon it . In the mean time having been repeatedly
115_110_003_02_02 called upon to " make his arrangements " he had accord-
115_110_003_02_03 -ingly laid out thousands , upon the faith of the
115_110_003_02_04 original agreement as above stated .
115_110_003_02_05 It is now two years since every thing was agreed
115_110_003_02_06 upon , every thing in black and white , ready for signa-
115_110_003_02_07 -ture , had the consent of the Land-owners been forth-
115_110_003_02_08 -coming . During all this time the benefit of General
115_110_003_02_09 Bentham ' s mechanical inventions , diverted at Mr Ben-
115_110_003_02_10 -tham ' s instance from what would otherwise have been
115_110_003_02_11 their application to this ( of doing the work by the
115_110_003_02_12 labour of Convicts instead of the more advantageous
115_110_003_02_13 mode by steam ) has been lost : one seventh of the
115_110_003_02_14 term of his patent has been consumed : workmen ,
115_110_003_02_15 collected with great difficulty , have been kept in waiting
115_110_003_02_16 ( without a possibility of making any thing saleable
115_110_003_02_17 of their work ) at a great expence . No idea has
115_110_003_02_18 been ever entertained of making Mr Bentham
115_110_003_02_19 any sort of satisfaction for these losses . Such are
115_110_003_02_20 the circumstances under which Mr Ford ( surely for
115_110_003_02_21 want of being sufficiently apprised of these ) proposes
115_110_003_02_22 that Mr Bentham ' s Representatives should be
115_110_003_02_23 loaded with a new charge to the amount of £15,000 .
115_110_003_02_24 As to arbitration , it is what Mr Bentham pro-
115_110_003_02_25 -posed in regard to other points , and could have very
115_110_003_02_26 little apprehension from in regard to this , supposing

071_169_002_05_07 when there is not much bad Coin current in a country ; it never

071_169_002_05_09 : medy will either be inefficacious or unprofitable . + Unless the Law
071_169_002_05_10 be strictly executed it will not put a stop to the obnoxious prac=
071_169_002_05_11 tice ; and if it be , the mischief of execution may be greater than
071_169_002_05_12 the service done by the suppression of the offence . the worse State
071_169_002_05_13 the Coinage is in , the more apt is the person who is to receive ,
071_169_002_05_14 to be negligent about the money he accepts ; much more the per=
071_169_002_05_15 : son who is to pay , about the money which he offers . The only
071_169_002_05_16 ground upon which any thing can be said in favour of a provi=
071_169_002_05_17 : sion of such severity in such a case is this : that the putting
071_169_002_05_18 of bad Money under such circumstances is looked upon as con=
071_169_002_05_19 : clusive evidence of complicity with the coiners : upon which ground
071_169_002_05_20 punishing the transaction above described is taking an evidentiary
071_169_002_05_21 act and turning it into a principal Offence . But in a bad state of

116_135_001_02_01 &214
116_135_001_02_02 p . 213 . Whatever construction is to be put upon it [ the
116_135_001_02_03 King ' s proclamation in Granada ] which perhaps may be very
116_135_001_02_04 difficult through all the cares to which it may be applied ,
116_135_001_02_05 it la alludes to a gorve government by laws in being , and
116_135_001_02_06 by courts of justices , not by a legislative authority , until
116_135_001_02_07 an assembly should be called .
116_135_001_02_08 pp 213,214 We therefore think , that by the two proclamations
116_135_001_02_09 and the commission to governor Melville , the King had im-
116_135_001_02_10 -mediately and irrecoverably granted to all who were or
116_135_001_02_11 should become inhabitants , or who had , or should regain
116_135_001_02_12 property in the island of Granada , or more generally
116_135_001_02_13 to all whom it might concern , that the subordinate
116_135_001_02_14 legislation ever over the island should be exercised by
116_135_001_02_15 an assembly with the consent of the governor and
116_135_001_02_16 council , in like manner as the other islands belonging
116_135_001_02_17 to the king .
116_135_001_02_18 Therefore , though the abolishing the duties of the French
116_135_001_02_19 King and the substituting this tax in its stead , which
116_135_001_02_20 according to the finding in this special verdict is paid
116_135_001_02_21 in all the British Leeward Islands , yet , through the
116_135_001_02_22 inattention of the king ' servants , in investing the order
116_135_001_02_23 in which the instruments should have passed , and
116_135_001_02_24 been nor notoriously published , the last act is contraducing
116_135_001_02_25 to , and a violation of the first , and is therefore void .
116_135_001_02_26 How proper soever it may be in sep respect of the
116_135_001_02_27 object of the letters patent of the 20th July , 1766 , to use

116_135_001_02_29 " it can only now be done , by the assembly of the island ,

073_071_002_01_10 instances as the Number of whi such as these

073_071_002_01_13 accrues from the using it as long as it lasts , but

073_071_002_01_16 only petty ones are yet Offences but this

071_111_001_03_01 Of Family Imposture .
071_111_001_04_01 Family Imposture is where a person in the intent of
071_111_001_04_02 enjoying or causing another to enjoy the benefit of being reputed to stand
071_111_001_04_03 ( A )
071_111_001_04_04 in a certain degree of family relationship to such another person or per=
071_111_001_04_05 : sons falsely pretends himself or another to stand in that degree of re=
071_111_001_04_06 =lationship to the prejudice of some other person , and knowing such
071_111_001_04_07 pretension to be false .
071_111_001_04_08 Exposition
071_111_001_04_09 [ ( A ) Relationship ] 1 . It matters not of what nature or degree the
071_111_001_04_10 relationship is : whether natural by passing for the Son or Daughter
071_111_001_04_11 Father or Mother or any other Blood-Relation of the person in ques=
071_111_001_04_12 : tion : or matrimonial ; to wit by passing for the Husband or Wife
071_111_001_04_13 of the person in question ; or by marriage , for instance , by passing
071_111_001_04_14 for the son or daughter , or father or mother or other blood-relation
071_111_001_04_15 of the Husband or Wife of the person in question .
071_111_001_04_16 2 . Accordingly when a woman produces brings up or recognizes
071_111_001_04_17 any person for her Child , knowing that person not to be her Child ,
071_111_001_04_18 it is a species of Family Imposture .

116_071_001_03_05 " completely monopolized , that the settlers had but few opportunities
116_071_001_03_06 " of getting the full value for their crops . A few wo words will
116_071_001_03_07 " place this iniquitous combination in its proper light .
116_071_001_03_08 " The settler found himself thrust out from the granary , by
116_071_001_03_09 " a man whose greater opulence created greater influence . He
116_071_001_03_10 " was then driven by his necessities to dispose of his grain
116_071_001_03_11 " for less than half its value . To whom did he dispose of it !
116_071_001_03_12 " to the very man whose greater opulence enabled him to
116_071_001_03_13 " purchase it , and whose greater influence could get it
116_071_001_03_14 " received into the public store " _
116_071_001_03_15 Orders had been repeatedly issued on this very subject ,
116_071_001_03_16 " the store keepers being most pointedly directed to give the
116_071_001_03_17 " preference to the man whose grain was the pro produce
116_071_001_03_18 " of his own labour ; and if any favour were shewn , to let
116_071_001_03_19 it be to the poor but industrious settler who might be

116_616_001_03_01 and Penitentiary Houses upon do are so identical
116_616_001_03_02 in principle , that ( even without adverting to the
116_616_001_03_03 vicinity between the first and the second floors of
116_616_001_03_04 the same edifice ) a man may without much
116_616_001_03_05 apprehension of error venture to state them as
116_616_001_03_06 coming out of the same shop . _
116_616_001_03_07 Up Upon the principles I have thus ventured
116_616_001_03_08 to point to in the improved prisons in question ,
116_616_001_03_09 present or future , one drawback from the goodness
116_616_001_03_10 of the economy _ one great drawback and than an
116_616_001_03_11 unavoidable one _ is the smallness of the scale .
116_616_001_03_12 Another is the shortness of the term which , in those
116_616_001_03_13 receptacles for petty offenders , the improved hands
116_616_001_03_14 have to learn the business in , and afford a
116_616_001_03_15 compensation , for the time and materials consumed
116_616_001_03_16 without profit , during the season of primaeval
116_616_001_03_17 awkwardness . _
116_616_001_03_18 Under these disadvantages , together with that
116_616_001_03_19 which results from the difference between the
116_616_001_03_20 wages of labour , as compared with the expence of
116_616_001_03_21 maintenance , here and in America , I should not
116_616_001_04_01 20 or 21 times as much as in the case of Cold Bath
116_616_001_04_02 Fel Fields . Cold Bath Fields proved bad ground : Battersea

116_616_001_04_04 Rise was excellent But Cold Bath Fields is up
116_616_001_04_05 and finished : and the case of Battersea Rise affords
116_616_001_04_06 neither finish nor commencement , nor any thing

115_073_002_02_12 to the Goal from which he shall have been removed ; And Whereas it
115_073_002_02_13 is therein also provided that after the removal of any offender under

072_102_002_04_12 The signs of a man ' s intending not to be amenable to law

072_102_002_05_02 X The chief use of these instructions is to settle the ideas of the Judge
072_102_002_05_03 on this subject and enable him to determine when a man is guilty . As
072_102_002_05_04 to the offender , he knows well enough when he is guilty without danger
072_102_002_05_05 of mistakes ; on this account the insertion of this article does not seem so
072_102_002_05_06 necessary as that of some other parts in the popular part of the Law .
072_102_002_05_07 It seems rather to concern the function of the Judge and to belong therefore
072_102_002_05_08 to the Title of Procedure .

071_107_002_04_02 For disturbing a man in the exercise of conjugal rights
071_107_002_04_03 the Offender ' s punishment may be as follows
071_107_002_04_04 1 . He may be banished the presence of the husband or that
071_107_002_04_05 of the Wife or both for a time or forever .
071_107_002_04_06 2 . He may be prohibited from holding correspondence with
071_107_002_04_07 the Wife for a time or forever .
071_107_002_04_08 Justifications are

071_107_002_04_15 are as follows
071_107_002_04_16 1 . Where the Wife having reasonable ground to apprehend
071_107_002_04_17 cruelty on the part of her husband , absents herself from him
071_107_002_04_18 in the intention of seeking her remedy at Law . As to what is

116_639_001_02_01 presumption in regard to will _ the clearest proof
116_639_001_02_02 of a disposition at least , not to grudge exertions
116_639_001_02_03 toward the application of a remedy , howsoever that
116_639_001_02_04 disposition might be overruled by other circumstances .
116_639_001_02_05 From the mere circumstance of a man ' s having
116_639_001_02_06 given information of a mischief , the conclusion is
116_639_001_02_07 certainly far enough from being a necessary one , that
116_639_001_02_08 whether obtainable or not obtainable , he would him-
116_639_001_02_09 -self be a fit person to be employed in the appli-
116_639_001_02_10 -cation of a remedy . A person so circumstanced is
116_639_001_02_11 however the first person the idea of whom would
116_639_001_02_12 naturally present itself in that view , supposing him
116_639_001_02_13 not set aside by other specific considerations . I mean
116_639_001_02_14 always in the eye of any official person , to whom
116_639_001_02_15 the cure of the mischief was either the sole object or
116_639_001_02_16 so much as the primary object in view . To a mind
116_639_001_02_17 comtemplating the subject in any such point of view

071_169_001_05_04 it to be counterfeit , it will be impossible to prove as much by
071_169_001_05_05 any external evidence ; if then external evidence is required , the
071_169_001_05_06 facility of evading the Law will be such as to strip it of all
071_169_001_05_07 its efficacy : if no external evidence is required , but the know=

072_210_004_04_08 Observations
072_210_004_04_09 There are those who seem half inclined not to admit of
072_210_004_04_10 any prosecution for this offence .
072_210_004_04_11 The parable of the Sword and the Scabbard quoted on
072_210_004_04_12 this occasion by Mr Voltaire , + may pass very well as a jest , but
072_210_004_04_13 will never do as a Rule of Law . It fails absolutely where the Wo :
072_210_004_04_14 : man is held motionless either by force or terror : where through
072_210_004_04_15 weariness or affright her senses fail her , and she falls into a
072_210_004_04_16 a
072_210_004_04_17 Swoon . It fails still more evidently where the Ravisher has a :
072_210_004_04_18 : ny one to assist him . Certain it is however , that prosecutions
072_210_004_04_19 for this Offence ought to be regarded with a jealous eye ; and
072_210_004_04_20 that the comparative appearance of the parties in point of strength
072_210_004_04_21 may furnish evidence of such force , as the positive testimony of
072_210_004_04_22 any single person will hardly countervail .

071_101_004_04_02 The sex and number and age of the children is also to
071_101_004_04_03 placed under
071_101_004_04_04 be taken into the account . The males should be the
071_101_004_04_05 guardianship of the Father , the females under that of the
071_101_004_04_06 mother . The burthen of supporting them should be consi=

071_101_004_04_08 Where the parties are in such circumstances as to
071_101_004_04_09 admit of it , the Husband ifnot put away might be
071_101_004_04_10 obliged to make some kind of pecuniary amends to the
071_101_004_04_11 Wife , by addingto her separate allowance , if she has any ,
071_101_004_04_12 or engaging to leave her such or such a Sum by his Will .

071_101_004_04_14 Provisions like these were they often to be

071_101_004_04_16 toward maintaining
071_101_004_04_17 than it . The chief use of them is to subject the
071_101_004_04_18 that is
071_101_004_04_19 offender to a kind of disgrace ipso jure ; by giving
071_101_004_04_20 force and direction to the censure of the World . For this

071_131_002_04_06 for the benefit of trade in general . Offences against the former

071_131_002_04_24 Animals that may be considered as noxious to man may

071_018_003_04_17 2 . The obligation you are under to assist a fellow creature
071_018_003_04_18 is the stronger the greater the danger appears to be which

072_104_002_04_10 Let the Judge take heed that he be not imposed upon by
072_104_002_04_11 false pretenses of necessity . Such a necessity can seldom happen
072_104_002_04_12 where there is a public establishment for the poor .

071_190_002_04_07 in other cases . For Insolvency thus circumstanced there would
071_190_002_04_08 need no separate procedure . It would appear upon the face
071_190_002_04_09 of the suit in question .
071_190_002_04_10 For Insolvency which has been fraudulent ex-post-facto
071_190_002_04_11 the punishment might be the same as where it was fraudulent
071_190_002_04_12 ab initio . Any pretended conveyance would be void of course ;
071_190_002_04_13 and a pecuniary punishment , and in aid of it imprisonment ,
071_190_002_04_14 might be inflicted on all such as were parties or privies to the
071_190_002_04_15 fraud . They might even be made to share the disgrace of
071_190_002_04_16 the Insolvent by means of the ignominious Habit .
071_190_002_04_17 For Insolvency in despite of Justice the Offender might
071_190_002_04_18 be dieted in the black Dungeon till he complies . This , it will

072_101_002_04_06 that is whether it be valuable to any person in general ; as a piece

072_101_002_04_08 that is whether it be valuable to any particular person or per=

072_101_002_04_13 when it is taken be a time at which it possesses or appears about
072_101_002_04_14 to possess a Value ; as a common Pebble or piece of Stick at the time

071_159_002_04_10 The ignominious punishment above appointed
071_159_002_04_11 ought not for the first offence to be applied to persons of
071_159_002_04_12 any degree of responsibility : for instance to persons
071_159_002_04_13 who have established shops or warehouses . It ought

071_106_001_04_02 If a married Woman commit Polygamy with a single

071_106_001_04_06 Polygamy together they shall be punished in a heavier degree
071_106_001_04_07 as for double Adultery .
071_106_001_04_08 Observations .
071_106_001_04_09 Polygamy on the part of the Man is an aggravated
071_106_001_04_10 species of fraud . This Fraud may have two Objects ; the person of
071_106_001_04_11 the deluded Woman , or her fortune . It is a compound as it were
071_106_001_04_12 Defraudment
071_106_001_04_13 of two other crimes , Seduction and The mischief of it
071_106_001_04_14 stand
071_106_001_04_15 however does not perfectly and necessarily upon a par with
071_106_001_04_16 that of either of those crimes .
071_106_001_04_17 First with regard to Seduction . The disgrace brought upon
071_106_001_04_18 the Woman by Polygamy is not so great as that which is brought
071_106_001_04_19 upon her by Seduction . Her chastity remains unstained . She
071_106_001_04_20 has been unfortunate but not culpable . She has parted indeed
071_106_001_04_21 with that treasure which can never be regained ; but it was

072_048_003_03_01 Offences against the external Security of the State .
072_048_003_04_01 it may happen that a jurisdiction which does not constitute
072_048_003_04_02 a man a subject may possess as much influence over him
072_048_003_04_03 as one that does .
072_048_003_04_04 Correspondent to the term subject is the term Allegi=
072_048_003_04_05 : ance . When a man is considered as being subject to any
072_048_003_04_06 State by birth his allegiance is called natural : when by
072_048_003_04_07 residence it is termed local .
072_048_003_04_08 It is evident that it is only in as far as our own
072_048_003_04_09 State possesses a Jurisdiction over a person that it can possi=
072_048_003_04_10 : bly be considered as responsible for the conduct of that per=
072_048_003_04_11 : son . In other words it is only in as far as he is understood
072_048_003_04_12 to be subject to the jurisdiction of our own State that any
072_048_003_04_13 conduct of his can in the way of provocation expose
072_048_003_04_14 our own state to the enmity of any other . In point of prac=
072_048_003_04_15 : tice it seems to be only for the conduct of such persons as
072_048_003_04_16 are under its allegiance that our own state is commonly look=
072_048_003_04_17 : ed upon as responsible . Not but there might be reason for
072_048_003_04_18 considering it as responsible for all persons who are in any
072_048_003_04_19 other way subject to its jurisdiction . Nor indeed is the man=
072_048_003_04_20 : ner in which this matter is considered perfectly uniform
072_048_003_04_21 and determinate .

096_051_004_02_01 Sect.1 .
096_051_004_02_02 Of Law in General .
096_051_004_03_01 in the second case it means neither more nor less than a com-
096_051_004_03_02 -mand only expressed in an obscure and far fetched manner .
096_051_004_03_03 The next thing the definition tells us of a Law , is that it is " prescri-
096_051_004_03_04 -bed " . As to the word " prescribed , " what it was intended to mean -
096_051_004_03_05 here , it would be dangerous to say : especially if what I suspect
096_051_004_03_06 be true , that with the appearance of meaning something , it was
096_051_004_03_07 intended to mean nothing .
096_051_004_03_08 I can speak with a little more certainty as to what it means a
096_051_004_03_09 page or two farther on . + It there means either to speak,to write
096_051_004_03_10 or in general to make signs , at any rate to communicate ideas .
096_051_004_03_11 It ( that is , Law ) says he , " is likewise a rule prescribed . Be-
096_051_004_03_12 -cause a bare resolution confined in the breast of the Legisla-
096_051_004_03_13 -tor , with out manifesting itself by some external sign,can never
096_051_004_03_14 be properly a Law . It is requisite that this resolution be no-
096_051_004_03_15 -tified to those who are to know it " [ p . 45 ] .
096_051_004_03_16 To do our Author justice , it must be acknowledged , that though
096_051_004_03_17 what is said of Law here , is said of Law general without res-
096_051_004_03_18 -triction , the paragraph in which it occurs stands next after a
096_051_004_03_19 Paragraph in which municipal Law alone is mentioned .
096_051_004_03_20 But " dictated " is the word he uses in the next page after that
096_051_004_03_21 we are now considering ; the subject of Law in general still upon
096_051_004_03_22 the carpet " dictated , " a word which plainly refers to speech
096_051_004_03_23 or writing . This being the case , the work he has cut out for

116_626_002_02_05 of Portland determined to " crowd the County Gaols "
116_626_002_02_06 for fear of " their being neglected . " - Such is the energy
116_626_002_02_07 with which Lord Pelham has forced a fifth hundred
116_626_002_02_08 a year into the hands of the Police Magistrates -

116_626_002_02_11 in a year shall be taken at the Hulks- such is

116_626_002_02_19 Magistrates - Quarterly peepers at Hulks - and even " crowded "
116_626_002_02_20 " Gaols themselves " might come to be " neglected " : To a plain
116_626_002_02_21 understanding , could these ideal plans of these ideal Ma-
116_626_002_02_22 -chiavels have been more directly repugnant to the
116_626_002_02_23 dicr decrease of crimes than the real plan of the
116_626_002_02_24 real Machiavels to the diminution of the mischief
116_626_002_02_25 of of pensions ? - Are not support and opposition -
116_626_002_02_26 plain dealing & deceit - truth & falsehood - right & wrong -
116_626_002_02_27 merit and guilt confounded and if possible rendered

116_100_001_01_03 a head upon his shoulders was not a more an object of more

116_100_001_01_08 personage _ more of them than he cares to think of _ on the score
116_100_001_01_09 of this humble , and as he thought innocent attempt , to sacrifice
116_100_001_01_10 a moderate and well-weighed portion of personal profit , upon the
116_100_001_01_11 altar of public justice . It was but t ' other day that a gentleman in

116_100_001_01_16 to number this among my " flights " : this simple one possessing of
116_100_001_01_17 itself a sufficient degree of eccentricity to ground a presumption

116_100_001_01_19 The gentleman had not then by any means made up his mind

116_100_001_01_22 at least the only cause which it was found convenient to

096_051_002_03_05 easy to apprehend
096_051_002_03_06 should be more simple in it ' s conception than that of the term
096_051_002_03_07 they are made use of to define
096_051_002_03_08 to be defined : it should be the same at one time as at ano-
096_051_002_03_09 -ther : it should be true of one as well as another of the things cha-
096_051_002_03_10 -racterized by the term to be defined : it should be such as may con
096_051_002_03_11 tribute to distinguish the things defined from other things they
096_051_002_03_12 may be in danger of being confounded with . I
096_051_002_03_13 In short if we may be allowed to say what it ought not to be : it ought
096_051_002_03_14 uninstructive
096_051_002_03_15 not to be unmeaning , dark , ambiguous , fluctuating , narrow ,
096_051_002_03_16 or uncharacteristic . I am in great doubt how this description
096_051_002_03_17 of a good definition will tally with our Author ' s .
096_051_002_03_18 The first thing we are told of Law is , that it is a rule of action
096_051_002_03_19 This is what may be very true . But what we are the wiser for it ,
096_051_002_03_20 or how it , or how it can serve to distinguish Law from any thing
096_051_002_03_21 it is in danger of being confounded with is rather more than I
096_051_002_03_22 can conceive . The signification of the world " rule " is so loose
096_051_002_03_23 and vague that it is still more difficult to fix the import of it
096_051_002_03_24 than that of the term Law : and the entire expression a rule
096_051_002_03_25 of action , as soon as it appears to express any thing , appears to
096_051_002_03_26 express what is rather an accidental attribute of any Law , than

071_158_002_04_03 and the accuser should each put his seal upon the goods

071_158_002_04_09 be passing by to see the condition of the goods and serve
071_158_002_04_10 as witnesses . For in a question so open to difference of

071_158_002_04_12 of which the limits are so uncertain more witnesses

073_003_001_02_02 inserting under one Title a proposition which
073_003_001_02_03 of itself is false , because if a Reader is lucky
073_003_001_02_04 in finding what there is nothing to admonish
073_003_001_02_05 him to look for he may chance to meet under
073_003_001_02_06 some indefinitely distant Title with a Qualification
073_003_001_02_07 that shall bring it back within the Line of

073_003_001_02_09 be told how perilous a Thing it is to have an

116_633_001_02_02 money from Parliament , to ease his County from
116_633_001_02_03 so much Poor-rate . It was but t ' other day as Your
116_633_001_02_04 Lordship has been seeing that Acts of Parliament were
116_633_001_02_05 broke through by great persons to shake the burthen
116_633_001_02_06 off from government & throw them upon the Counties .
116_633_001_02_07 Great persons giving themselves this trouble lay the

116_633_001_02_09 them to undo their own undoings , & get Parliament
116_633_001_02_10 to take it off the Counties ! The Counties did I

116_633_001_02_13 that the richest in the kingdom , & by a particu-

116_633_001_02_15 made on purpose ! _ A more unfortunately-timed
116_633_001_02_16 pretension , to all appearance at least , surely was
116_633_001_02_17 never brought forward , than this which has been
116_633_001_02_18 thus insinuated by a gentleman who , I dare answer
116_633_001_02_19 for him , meant nothing less than to offend times

115_108_001_01_03 for building a penetentiary House , &c &c _
115_108_001_01_04 The Title proposed by Mr . Bentham of
115_108_001_01_05 Panopticon is in every respect obviously
115_108_001_01_06 objectionable _ The word in the Act of
115_108_001_01_07 Parliament is " penitentiary House " , which had
115_108_001_01_08 better be retained . _
115_108_001_01_09 Instead of having an Estimate made
115_108_001_01_10 of the encreased prices of sundry Articles
115_108_001_01_11 since March 1793 , when the proposals by
115_108_001_01_12 Mr . Bentham were delivered , it will be better
115_108_001_01_13 to fix the Sum at £30,000 . _
115_108_001_01_14 The words " wholesome Food " should be
115_108_001_01_15 explained specifically , & this may be done
115_108_001_01_16 without injuring the principle , upon which
115_108_001_01_17 Mr . B . intends to act , as he may enumerate
115_108_001_01_18 a number of different sorts of food , and
115_108_001_01_19 particularize those kinds , which he means to
115_108_001_01_20 supply the persons under his Care with ,
115_108_001_01_21 provided any Alteration in their Diet
115_108_001_01_22 becomes necessary for the purpose of inforcing
115_108_001_01_23 amendment &c , but to leave the matter
115_108_001_01_24 entirely open under the general Words
115_108_001_01_25 " Wholsome Food " would be reposing too great
115_108_001_01_26 a discretion in any Government , who is not

073_061_001_03_02 It is for the intelligent Reader to decide whether
073_061_001_03_03 Explanations pushed to this Degree of Refinement
073_061_001_03_04 will or will not be of service upon the whole towards
073_061_001_03_05 the solving of such Doubts as a Jury might be
073_061_001_03_06 liable to entertain .
073_061_001_03_07 With this Idea ( concerning what shall &
073_061_001_03_08 what shall not amount to a taking ) coincide as
073_061_001_03_09 far as they go the received Doctrines of the Law .
073_061_001_03_10 On the affirmative it has been holden ,
073_061_001_03_11 that a Man who had taken off the Sheets of a Bed ,
073_061_001_03_12 and carried them down into the Hall , that a Man
073_061_001_03_13 who had pulled off the Skin or the Wool from a
073_061_001_03_14 Sheep , that a Man who had taken Plate out of a

073_061_001_03_16 acted as to consummate to this Purpose their respective

073_061_001_03_18 These Cases are indeed adduced by the practical

073_061_001_03_20 which the Forms require to be charged as a Fact contradistinct

035_320_001_02_06 formed by the reconsideration of all evidence
035_320_001_02_07 delivered in the course of the original exami-
035_320_001_02_08 nation : together with the consideration of any
035_320_001_02_09 such argumentation as is on this occasion made :
035_320_001_02_10 the sources of evidence , if more than one , are
035_320_001_02_11 now confronted and compared .
035_320_001_02_12 Art . 5 . The recapitulatory examination , the
035_320_001_02_13 Judge for his own satisfaction or that of the par-
035_320_001_02_14 -ties , has power to perform
035_320_001_02_15 : at the requisition of a party on either
035_320_001_02_16 side , he is bound to perform it .
035_320_001_02_17 Art . 6 . When it is of his own motion , no de-
035_320_001_02_18 finitive decree is pronounced : when it is in com-
035_320_001_02_19 -pliance with requisition as above , both defini-
035_320_001_02_20 tive decrees are provisionally pronounced , & to
035_320_001_02_21 them , the requisition makes reference .
035_320_001_02_22 Art . 7 . The provisionally definitive decrees

073_052_001_03_01 comparative
073_052_001_03_02 5.thly & lastly . I shall undertake the relative
073_052_001_03_03 Estimation of the several particular Offences into
073_052_001_03_04 which both Kinds of Distinctions have broken
073_052_001_03_05 the general Title .
073_052_001_03_06 Before we proceed further , the employing of
073_052_001_03_07 a few Words in fixing an Article of Nomenclature
073_052_001_03_08 will be by no Means an useless Digression : in
073_052_001_03_09 Order if possible to establish that Distinctness of
073_052_001_03_10 Conception which is very necessary to a commanding
073_052_001_03_11 Knowledge of the Subject , but which practical
073_052_001_03_12 Writers have appeared little sollicitous to transmit
073_052_001_03_13 or to acquire .
073_052_001_03_14 There are two Terms employed and that often
073_052_001_03_15 promiscuously in speaking of the Offence in Question
073_052_001_03_16 _ The one more popular in it ' s Use and ample in
073_052_001_03_17 it ' s Signification _ Theft _ The other more technical
073_052_001_03_18 in it ' s Use and confined in it ' s Signification _ Larceny .
073_052_001_03_19 The Verb " to steal " with it ' s Participle " stealing "
073_052_001_03_20 is exactly parallel in it ' s Use and commensurate in
073_052_001_03_21 it ' s Signification with the former of these , being the

116_619_001_02_01 Letter 3d
116_619_001_03_01 Persons who ( one might almost venture to affirm )
116_619_001_03_02 never saw the inside of a prison in their whole
116_619_001_03_03 lives _ persons by much too high to have ever
116_619_001_03_04 bestowed upon any such low object any thing
116_619_001_03_05 that call be called a thought _ persons who are
116_619_001_03_06 as much at home in " improved " prisons as
116_619_001_03_07 they are in " improved " colonies _ it is by such
116_619_001_03_08 lovers of improvements , and by the lovers of
116_619_001_03_09 such improvements , that the penitentiary system
116_619_001_03_10 in its most improved form has been consigned
116_619_001_03_11 to " relinquishment " , and the authority that pre-
116_619_001_03_12 -scribed it to contempt . _
116_619_001_03_13 intention ,
116_619_001_03_14 It was not my original , my Lord , to have
116_619_001_03_15 attempted giving Your Lordship on the present
116_619_001_03_16 occasion any trouble on the subject of the official
116_619_001_03_17 letter , to which the plan thus alluded to has
116_619_001_03_18 been consigned : but , having gone thus far , it is
116_619_001_03_19 becomes se necessary for me I fear to transcribe
116_619_001_03_20 a part of it at least , on pain of seeing the above
116_619_001_03_21 statement exposed to the suspicion of being ground-
116_619_001_03_22 -less , and perhaps as to the charge of being un-
116_619_001_03_23 -intelligible . The letter then to which the deter-
116_619_001_03_24 -mination in question , or at any rate the ex-
116_619_001_03_25 -pression of it was consigned , bears date the
116_619_001_03_26 14th of October 1799 : Signature that of the Duke of
116_619_001_03_27 Portland , at that time filling the high office Your
116_619_001_03_28 Lordship

116_641_001_02_01 That recommendation by subordinates should
116_641_001_02_02 be taken without enquiry is natural enough , customary
116_641_001_02_03 enough , certainly not illegal ; and so far without
116_641_001_02_04 dispute not culpable . In the present instance , for
116_641_001_02_05 judging of the propriety of the recommendation , or
116_641_001_02_06 of the views which gave it birth , two points may
116_641_001_02_07 afford some light : the one antecedent to the ap-
116_641_001_02_08 -pointment ; the other subsequent : the person
116_641_001_02_09 recommended for the office , & his conduct when
116_641_001_02_10 invested with it .
116_641_001_02_11 The gentleman who comes out of the pocket is
116_641_001_02_12 without dispute the friend of the wearer of the pocket
116_641_001_02_13 out of which he comes . - What are his other titles ?
116_641_001_02_14 To me , who neither am known nor know , he is known
116_641_001_02_15 by nothing but a name : nor even by name shall
116_641_001_02_16 he be spoken of by me . In matters of this kind -
116_641_001_02_17 where public money is thus disposed of - in my
116_641_001_02_18 estimate at least which never looks for any thing
116_641_001_02_19 more than human in the bulk of men - not the
116_641_001_02_20 receiver , but the donor- I had almost used another
116_641_001_02_21 word - is to blame . What is on record- what is pub-
116_641_001_02_22 -lic - may be mentioned without reserve : & it is
116_641_001_02_23 quite sufficient for the purpose . Lord Pelham , on
116_641_001_02_24 coming into office , finds him a Police Magistrate ,
116_641_001_02_25 at £400 a year . By one of Lord Pelham ' s two exertions ,
116_641_001_02_26 to this £400 is added another £100 , God knows why
116_641_001_02_27 or wherefore : and for decency ' s sake , and because
116_641_001_02_28 it could not be done otherwise - the whole corps of
116_641_001_02_29 the Police-Magistrates I mean - for as to drudges who
116_641_001_02_30 must attend , and must understand the business ,

115_085_003_02_01 or Governors of the said Penitentiary House or Houses , to
115_085_003_02_02 continue in such office or offices respectively , for such time &
115_085_003_02_03 under such conditions as his Majesty shall direct , who being
115_085_003_02_04 so appointed thereunto shall have the care , management ,
115_085_003_02_05 superintendence and control of the same and of all and
115_085_003_02_06 every offender and offenders who shall be delivered into his
115_085_003_02_07 or their custody , by the direction of his Majesty , His Heirs
115_085_003_02_08 or Successors , under such powers , directions , limitations and
115_085_003_02_09 restrictions as are contained in an Act made in the twenty
115_085_003_02_10 fourth year of his present Majesty ' s reign intitled An Act
115_085_003_02_11 for the effectual transportation of Felons and other Offenders &
115_085_003_02_12 to authorize the removal of Prisoners in certain cases , and for
115_085_003_02_13 other purposes therein mentioned , or under such other direct-
115_085_003_02_14 -ions limitations and restrictions as his Majesty shall un-
115_085_003_02_15 -der the powers of the said Act from time to time appoint "
115_085_003_02_16 And whereas in and by the said last mentioned Act power
115_085_003_02_17 is given to his Majesty to direct the removal of any Male
115_085_003_02_18 offender under sentence of death but reprieved during pleasure
115_085_003_02_19 or under sentence of transportation and appearing in manner
115_085_003_02_20 therein mentioned fit so to be removed to such place of confine-
115_085_003_02_21 -ment within England and Wales as his Majesty shall ap-
115_085_003_02_22 -point under the management of any Overseer appointed by
115_085_003_02_23 his Majesty , wherefore it is therein moreover provided
115_085_003_02_24 that every offender so removed shall continue in the place of con-
115_085_003_02_25 -finement , or be removed to and confined in any other place , as his
115_085_003_02_26 Majesty shall appoint , untill such offender shall be transported
115_085_003_02_27 or by the expiration of his term shall be entitled to his liberty
115_085_003_02_28 or untill his Majesty shall direct the return of such offender
115_085_003_02_29 to the Goal from which he shall have been removed ; " And

116_055_001_02_01 No 1 P . 136 . Decr 1790 . The harvest which was begun in the last ,
116_055_001_02_02 was completed in this month . In the abundance that was expected ,
116_055_001_02_03 every one was disappointed ; for , owing to a most tedious and un-
116_055_001_02_04 -fortunate drought during ten months , the wheat did not turn
116_055_001_02_05 out more than one third of what , from the quantity of ground
116_055_001_02_06 sown with that grain , there was a reasonable expectation of its
116_055_001_02_07 producing , had the season been moderately favourable . This was the
116_055_001_02_08 more seriously felt , as at one time a hope was entertained of
116_055_001_02_09 reaping grain sufficient to supply the colony with bread for two
116_055_001_02_10 years .
116_055_001_02_11 No 2 . P . 202 . March 1799 . The settlement was at this time much
116_055_001_02_12 in want of many necessary articles of life ; and when these were
116_055_001_02_13 brought by speculators and traders who occasionally touched there ,
116_055_001_02_14 they demanded more than 500 per cent above what the same
116_055_001_02_15 articles could have been sent out for from England , with every
116_055_001_02_16 addition of freight , insurance , &c . They saw the wants of the
116_055_001_02_17 colony and availed themselves of its necessities . _
116_055_001_02_18 No 3 P . 210 . May 1799 . A quantity of fresh pork having been for
116_055_001_02_19 some time secured into the store , there were found at this period six
116_055_001_02_20 months salt provisions remaining ; which , without this supply would
116_055_001_02_21 have been all consumed , and the colony left without animal food ,
116_055_001_02_22 save in the article of live stock , a resource on which it could not
116_055_001_02_23 have been prudent to have touched as a supply , except in a case
116_055_001_02_24 of the last necessity . _
116_055_001_02_25 Every encouragement was given to the curing of pork upon Norfolk Island ;
116_055_001_02_26 but the casks in which the salt meat was sent from England were in
116_055_001_02_27 general so extremely feeble by the time they arrived , that scarcely one in a
116_055_001_02_28 hundred was fit for that purpose a second time . Could any timber , fit
116_055_001_02_29 for this use , have been found in the country , yet a supply of hoops and
116_055_001_02_30 salt pans would have been necessary ; and unless it was cured in the winter
116_055_001_02_31 season , and the method observed by Captain Cook was practised at Norfolk Island ,
116_055_001_02_32 it remained a doubt whether it could be accomplished to any considerable extent .
116_055_001_02_33 The price of fresh pork having been raised in consequence of the failure
116_055_001_02_34 of the late harvest , as a temporary relief to those who had suffered by that
116_055_001_02_35 misfortune , the commissary was , at the close of this month , directed to re-
116_055_001_02_36 -turn to the price formerly established , viz . nine-pence per pound .
116_055_001_02_37 The state of the public stores with respect to salt provisions
116_055_001_02_38 having been carefully examined , it became necessary to make a small
116_055_001_02_39 reduction of the ration in time , in order to prevent a greater .

071_101_002_04_07 allowed to put him away and marry again , or the power
071_101_002_04_08 may be given her of subjecting him to some kind of confine=

071_101_002_04_11 [ ( A ) Second Offence ] By a second Offence is to be understood on this

071_101_002_04_15 The disposal of the fortunes of the married persons upon
071_101_002_04_16 the dissolution of the marriage in this case must be determined
071_101_002_04_17 partly by the circumstances of the parties , partly by the nature
071_101_002_04_18 of the different kinds of property established in the state .
071_101_002_04_19 The most common case is that in which neither party had
071_101_002_04_20 at the time of the marriage or have acquired since , any property

071_188_002_03_01 plan the order of the chapters or titles relative to offences of the
071_188_002_03_02 First Class for example would stand thus : Tit . I . Of Sim=
071_188_002_03_03 : ple Personal Injuries . Tit . II . Of Attempts to commit Sim=
071_188_002_03_04 : ple Personal Injuries . Tit . III . Of attempts to commit Sim=
071_188_002_03_05 : ple Personal Injuries by Forgery : or of Forgery in subservi=

071_188_002_03_07 to Simple Personal Injuries . Tit . V . Of Irreparable Personal

071_188_002_03_09 : nal Injuries : and so on .
071_188_002_03_10 The above plan seems the best accomodated to the pur=

071_188_002_03_12 to that of conciseness . Let an account be taken of the several
071_188_002_03_13 species or degrees of punishment to be applied to the several
071_188_002_03_14 different species of Forgery : the former list will be much
071_188_002_03_15 more numerous than the latter . To each different lot of pu=

071_188_002_03_17 as are punished with that punishment . The form of the

115_072_003_02_10 with interest at the rate of 5 per cent from the
115_072_003_02_11 day of the delivery of such account to the day on
115_072_003_02_12 which the amount thereof shall have been
115_072_003_02_13 received by him . Provided that if any reduction
115_072_003_02_14 of price shall within the same period have
115_072_003_02_15 taken place in respect of any other article or
115_072_003_02_16 articles so employed or consumed as aforesaid ; he

115_072_003_02_19 to render a like account of every such reduction
115_072_003_02_20 at the same periods respectively with every
115_072_003_02_21 such account of alledged enhancement ; the am-

115_072_003_02_23 the amount of such enhancement as aforesaid :
115_072_003_02_24 reduction
115_072_003_02_25 or if no such dominution shall have taken place ,
115_072_003_02_26 then to make declaration to that effect : and

072_049_001_03_01 Offences against the external Security of the State .
072_049_001_04_01 about the manner in which it should be punished . It is
072_049_001_04_02 an offence against one ' s own state , as such it ought to be
072_049_001_04_03 punished in the same manner as an offence of the same
072_049_001_04_04 kind committed against a native . While the foreigner conti=
072_049_001_04_05 : nues in the dominions of one ' s own state , and as such
072_049_001_04_06 remains contributory to its well-being and subject to its
072_049_001_04_07 authority it has the same reason nearly for affording
072_049_001_04_08 protection to him as to a native . In this point of view
072_049_001_04_09 it is as much affected by the primary mischief of the in=
072_049_001_04_10 : jury done to him ; and in any point of view it is as much
072_049_001_04_11 affected by the secondary mischief as if he were a native .
072_049_001_04_12 to
072_049_001_04_13 It will of course therefore give him the same degree of
072_049_001_04_14 protection as to a native ; and unless in the particular
072_049_001_04_15 case of a privileged person the state of which he is a member
072_049_001_04_16 will hardly expect he should have a greater .
072_049_001_04_17 The same measures which serve to provide only for
072_049_001_04_18 the internal tranquillity of the state when committed a=
072_049_001_04_19 : gainst a member of the state , are requisite to provide as
072_049_001_04_20 well for the internal tranquillity as for the external se=
072_049_001_04_21 : curity of it in this . Offences thus circumstanced require
072_049_001_04_22 not therefore to be put under a separate title . They fall
072_049_001_04_23 naturally

073_067_001_02_01 THEFT
073_067_001_03_01 in all its present Minuteness : is covering at once
073_067_001_03_02 all those Inlets to Impunity under equal guilt , which
073_067_001_03_03 an acute and interested Examination of the subsisting
073_067_001_03_04 Doctrine might discover .
073_067_001_03_05 But here again another Question
073_067_001_03_06 may occur ( for it has already occurred to Writers +
073_067_001_03_07 in other Words ) whether the presence of this Consciousness
073_067_001_03_08 is to be left to the Jury , ( to whom I refer the Cognizance
073_067_001_03_09 of it without Hesitation for the Reasons mentioned
073_067_001_03_10 under the word " Taking " ) to infer without further
073_067_001_03_11 without further rule
073_067_001_03_12 Rule by their Discretion ; or whether any such points
073_067_001_03_13 conclusively
073_067_001_03_14 of Behaviour from which it may be infer ' d by Law are
073_067_001_03_15 capable of being number ' d & ascertained ?
073_067_001_03_16 I have taken no small pains to find an
073_067_001_03_17 Answer to this Question , and the Results is that I
073_067_001_03_18 conceive they are reducible to one of these 4 viz :
073_067_001_03_19 1st . Concealment of the Act of taking 2d Conceal-
073_067_001_03_20 -ment afterwards of the Thing taken . 3d Concealment
073_067_001_03_21 of the taking Taker ' s own Person . 4th Flight .
073_067_001_03_22 I also carried on the Disquisition to a
073_067_001_03_23 still further Degree of Minuteness by tracing
073_067_001_03_24 out other Circumstances which being such

116_400_001_03_03 them _ confusion and inconsistency _ Will not allow Panopticon any Convicts
116_400_001_03_04 that can either be transported or kept in the Jails . it would check the imprisonment
116_400_001_03_05 in the Jails _ Will not execute the Acts _ because the expence would fall on government
116_400_001_03_06 yet proposes 2150 as the number .
116_400_001_03_07 Mr King having laid before me a Letter from Mr Long
116_400_001_03_08 of the 27th ultie desiring , by command of your Lordships , to be
116_400_001_03_09 apprized of the number of Convicts , which the Panopticon pro-
116_400_001_03_10 -posed to be erected by Mr Bentham , is intended to accommo-
116_400_001_03_11 ( b )
116_400_001_03_12 -date . I have examined the Acts of the 19th and 34th of his
116_400_001_03_13 present Majesty relative to the building of Penitentiary Houses
116_400_001_03_14 for confining and employing in hard labour , person convicted
116_400_001_03_15 of transportable and other Crimes . _
116_400_001_03_16 I understand the objects of those Acts to be , that such
116_400_001_03_17 Penitentiary Houses should be used principally as receptacles
116_400_001_03_18 for such transportable Convicts , as the several gaols of the
116_400_001_03_19 respective Counties cannot contain , from the time of their receiving
116_400_001_03_20 sentence , till an opportunity may offer for their being trans-
116_400_001_03_21 -ported . ( c )
116_400_001_03_22 With respect to the probably number of transportable Convicts ,
116_400_001_03_23 no safer rule can be adopted , than by taking the greatest num-
116_400_001_03_24 -ber of the four last years of Peace : [ though it may increase , yet
116_400_001_03_25 the increase yet th of live stock & will probably more than
116_400_001_03_26 counterbalance the difference .... . ] ] ( d )
116_400_001_03_27 As to other Convicts , it will depend on the opinion of
116_400_001_03_28 the Judges who try them , what number of them it may be
116_400_001_03_29 proper to confine in the Panopticon : it is impossible to ascer-
116_400_001_03_30 -tain with accuracy the number to which they may amount :
116_400_001_03_31 but I incline to think it would be very inexpedient to move
116_400_001_03_32 such Persons from the country Gaols , unless the crowded state
116_400_001_03_33 of those Gaols should render it absolutely necessary : for it
116_400_001_03_34 would naturally tend _ not only to check that spirit of im-
116_400_001_03_35 -provement , which now so universally prevails , in the several
116_400_001_03_36 Counties .

072_100_002_04_01 much less than the punishment appointed for the same
072_100_002_04_02 offences in any body of Laws in force is made as light as
072_100_002_04_03 possible consistent with it , being in ordinary cases more
072_100_002_04_04 than equivilent after the allowance to be made on the
072_100_002_04_05 score of remitness and uncertainty to the profit of the offence
072_100_002_04_06 In many cases it appears smaller in that case the offence
072_100_002_04_07 object
072_100_002_04_08 will most assuredly be committed . Where gain is the subject
072_100_002_04_09 every part of the gain how indirect soever it arise , so as it
072_100_002_04_10 be but foreseen to be likely to arise will operate as a
072_100_002_04_11 motive to the commissions of the offence as much any other
072_100_002_04_12 equal part . If the object be mischief so will every part

072_100_002_04_14 If the object be gain and not mischief , yet mischief be
072_100_002_04_15 liable to be committed in prosecution of the gain , even here
072_100_002_04_16 if there be any part of the mischief without its punish=

115_067_002_02_10 the total number of such supernumeraries , reckoning from the
115_067_002_02_11 first , shall be encreased by the reception of such latter supernu-

115_067_002_02_13 committed in the first instance , and the number be afterwards
115_067_002_02_14 reduced to one hundred , then the addition shall not be paid in
115_067_002_02_15 respect of any further supernumeraries which may successively
115_067_002_02_16 be added to the one hundred , untill the number of supernumera-

096_101_001_02_01 considered is expedient , but inexpedient relatively
096_101_001_02_02 to that Law which may have a lighter penalty .
096_101_001_02_03 The greater Number of subsisting Regulations
096_101_001_02_04 concerning the higher Offences will be perhaps be
096_101_001_02_05 found to come under this Case .
096_101_001_02_06 does
096_101_001_02_07 8 . When the Act is such as would produce Un-
096_101_001_02_08 -happiness in the Community , and less than
096_101_001_02_09 does the Penalty : which Penalty , so as to be
096_101_001_02_10 sufficient to answer the End in an ordinary
096_101_001_02_11 Degree of preventing it , is also the least that
096_101_001_02_12 can be assigned
096_101_001_02_13 Such I conceive to be the Law giving Da-
096_101_001_02_14 -mages for Battery .
096_101_001_02_15 This , as far as depends upon the Choice of
096_101_001_02_16 the Act prohibited , and the Degree of the penalty , || is
096_101_001_02_17 the Maximum of Perfection .
096_101_001_02_18 The same is to be observed mutatis mutandis
096_101_001_02_19 concerning a mandatory Law .
096_101_001_02_20 As the Result of our Inquiries brings
096_101_001_02_21 us to conclude in Approbation or Disapprobation of
096_101_001_02_22 any Law , as far as it concerns it ' s Substance , it will

115_065_001_02_09 Jeremy Benthamm of Lincoln ' s Inn Esquire , of the other part .
115_065_001_02_10 Whereas in and by the Statute passed on the seventh
115_065_001_02_11 day of July in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred
115_065_001_02_12 and ninety-four and of his Majesty ' s Reign the thirty fourth
115_065_001_02_13 intitled An Act for erecting a Penitentiary House or Houses for
115_065_001_02_14 confining and employing Convicts it is provided among other
115_065_001_02_15 things that the Commissioners of the Treasury for the time be-
115_065_001_02_16 -ing after fixing upon a certain piece of Ground therein described
115_065_001_02_17 for the purpose of causing to be erected thereupon one or more
115_065_001_02_18 Penitentiary House or Houses , for the purpose of confining and
115_065_001_02_19 employing in hard labour such Convicts as are therein also
115_065_001_02_20 described , and appointing a Feoffee for the making purchase
115_065_001_02_21 thereof in manner therein also mentioned , may contract or
115_065_001_02_22 agree with any person or persons for the erecting and building
115_065_001_02_23 one or more Penitentiary House or Houses upon the said
115_065_001_02_24 ground in such manner and under and for such considera-
115_065_001_02_25 -tions , terms , conditions , powers , limitations and restrictions
115_065_001_02_26 as the said Commissioners shall deem necessary and expedi-
115_065_001_02_27 -ent , and shall cause to be inserted in such Contract or
115_065_001_02_28 Contracts such lawful clauses , covenants , and agreements , as

115_112_003_02_01 Article 18 . Mr Bentham submits to Mr
115_112_003_02_02 Ford ' s Proposal in regard to the excluding out of
115_112_003_02_03 the Estimate all ages under ten years : but he flatters
115_112_003_02_04 himself Mr Ford will not think it unreasonable
115_112_003_02_05 that the exclusion should be suspended for the first
115_112_003_02_06 year , considering the dangers to health that threaten
115_112_003_02_07 an institution of this sort at its outset , when per-
115_112_003_02_08 -sons of that description are received in such large
115_112_003_02_09 multitudes at once from all the Jails in the King-
115_112_003_02_10 -dom ( of which a few only have been so improved
115_112_003_02_11 as not to be occasionally the seats of pestilence )
115_112_003_02_12 into an unseasoned building : dangers against which
115_112_003_02_13 the best professional advice seconded by the strictest
115_112_003_02_14 attention may be no adequate defense .
115_112_003_02_15 In the Hulks under Mr Campbel ' s care the
115_112_003_02_16 mortality was very considerable at first as appears
115_112_003_02_17 by Howard ' s Books , and by the Reports made
115_112_003_02_18 to the House of Commons . At Portsmouth or
115_112_003_02_19 Plymouth out of about 700 there died in one year
115_112_003_02_20 between 1/6 and 1/5 of the whole number , as appears
115_112_003_02_21 from the Reports made to the King ' s Bench from
115_112_003_02_22 which Mr Bentham has extracts .
115_112_003_02_23 According to this alteration the words to be
115_112_003_02_24 inserted might stand as follows . After the words
115_112_003_02_25 " Dr Price " insert , " Provided that in the first year ' s
115_112_003_02_26 " account , in the computation of the deaths so to
115_112_003_02_27 be

115_086_001_02_01 after the day when the said intended Establishment shall be
115_086_001_02_02 in readiness to receive the said Convicts in pursuance to notice
115_086_001_02_03 as aforesaid : the said allowance of £27,000 together with the
115_086_001_02_04 supplemental allowance stipulated for as abovementioned ,
115_086_001_02_05 being intended to include all the charges attending the cus-
115_086_001_02_06 -tody , maintenance & employment of the said original num-
115_086_001_02_07 -ber of 1000 Convicts in manner hereinafter mentioned during
115_086_001_02_08 the first year : except only the amount of the premiums
115_086_001_02_09 for insurance herein after mentioned .
115_086_001_02_10 Art.6 . The said Jeremy Bentham and his Successors
115_086_001_02_11 as abovementioned shall moreover be respectively allowed to em-
115_086_001_02_12 -ploy the Prisoners for the proper benefit of them the said
115_086_001_02_13 Governors , to receive to themselves the whole produce and profit
115_086_001_02_14 of their labour , and the same to retain , subject only to the all-
115_086_001_02_15 -owances to be made to such prisoners in manner herein
115_086_001_02_16 after mentioned .
115_086_001_02_17 Art.7 . Each Prisoner shall be supplied every day with
115_086_001_02_18 wholesome food , as much as he shall choose : but the quality
115_086_001_02_19 in other respects is expressly reserved to the choice of the said
115_086_001_02_20 Jeremy Bentham and his Successors as a means of enga-
115_086_001_02_21 -ging the said Prisoners , without the spur of corporal seve-
115_086_001_02_22 -rities , to set their hands to labour .
115_086_001_02_23 Art.8 . Each Prisoner shall be kept properly cloathed , &
115_086_001_02_24 to that purpose shall be supplied at least once a year with
115_086_001_02_25 a compleat suit of such cloaths as shall be allotted , and with
115_086_001_02_26 a clean shirt at least twice in every week .
115_086_001_02_27 Each Prisoner shall be constantly supplied
115_086_001_02_28 with a separate bed and bedding of sufficient warmth , & kept in
115_086_001_02_29 a state of constant cleanliness ; clean sheeting or blanketing being
115_086_001_02_30 supplied to each at least once in every month .

071_163_003_04_01 exercise of it might be laid under certain restrictions . For in=
071_163_003_04_02 : stance no man might be allowed to use the instument in
071_163_003_04_03 question without a licence : nor should any man who was al=
071_163_003_04_04 it
071_163_003_04_05 : lowed to use be allowed to keep it by him at all times ; it
071_163_003_04_06 might be kept under several keys of which an officer , to
071_163_003_04_07 be appointed for the purpose , should have one , so as not to
071_163_003_04_08 be sued but in his presence .
071_163_003_04_09 As to the mere Act of Coining considered by itself
071_163_003_04_10 the chance of convicting a man of it upon direct proof is compa=
071_163_003_04_11 : ratively very slender ; such proof unless by some very ex=
071_163_003_04_12 : traordinary accident is never to be had but from the testi=
071_163_003_04_13 : mony of some of the confederates . This is owing to the par=
071_163_003_04_14 : ticular nature of the act which , however mischievous it
071_163_003_04_15 may be in its design and consequences , yet not being the
071_163_003_04_16 very act from which the mischief immediately takes its
071_163_003_04_17 birth is never in any likelyhood of being performed in pre=
071_163_003_04_18 sence of any of the parties who come afterwards to be injured
071_163_003_04_19 by it : by which circumstance that source of testimony is en=

071_185_004_04_01 Quest VII . Why the Punishment in this Case may
071_185_004_04_02 be fixed ,
071_185_004_04_03 Reason
071_185_004_04_04 Because the mischief is to be estimated in this Case
071_185_004_04_05 not from the particular consequences of any single Act , but from
071_185_004_04_06 the general consequences of the obnoxious habit . See Quest V .
071_185_004_04_07 It can answer therefore no purpose to make the pu=
071_185_004_04_08 : nishment rise and fall with the profit upon any single
071_185_004_04_09 offence . The profit which the punishment must be made
071_185_004_04_10 to outweigh is the profit not upon the particular Act , but
071_185_004_04_11 upon the habitual Practice . Now the quantum of the for=
071_185_004_04_12 : mer is susceptible of direct proof . But this is not the case
071_185_004_04_13 with the latter . It can be appraised no otherwise than by a
071_185_004_04_14 random calculation . This calculation may be the same for
071_185_004_04_15 all cases . It may therefore as well be made by the Legis=
071_185_004_04_16 : lator as by the Judge .
071_185_004_04_17 Quest . VIII . Why the indelible Stigma is here
071_185_004_04_18 employed ,
071_185_004_04_19 Reasons .
071_185_004_04_20 1 . Because the infamy will not be so intolerable in this
071_185_004_04_21 as

071_184_001_02_01 C
071_184_001_03_01 Of Frauds relative to the Coin .
071_184_001_04_01 of time cannot of himself turn to any thing . His habits of Skill
071_184_001_04_02 and honest Industry , if he ever had any , are obliterated ; his
071_184_001_04_03 reputation , if he ever had any , is gone . Frighten him from
071_184_001_04_04 practising Theft , he will have nothing left for it but to
071_184_001_04_05 turn Robber .
071_184_001_04_06 Between Coining and Robbery the case is different . A
071_184_001_04_07 man ' s being in the habit of Coining may in general be looked
071_184_001_04_08 upon as a presumption of his possessing some honest Art from
071_184_001_04_09 which this illicit practise is only an occasional deviation , and
071_184_001_04_10 to which if forced back by salutary terrors , he may at any
071_184_001_04_11 time return . A button maker or silversmith who has taken
071_184_001_04_12 to Coining , although he should cease to coin , may continue
071_184_001_04_13 to subsist : he has only to confine himself to the proper bu=
071_184_001_04_14 : siness of a silversmith or a button maker . On such a per=
071_184_001_04_15 : son therefore a punishment greater than even that for Rob=
071_184_001_04_16 : bery may have its effect without driving him into the prac=
071_184_001_04_17 : tice of the more atrocious offence : instead of driving him on to Rob=
071_184_001_04_18 : bery it may only drive him back to Button making .

073_063_001_03_01 common Sense & not of Law to say , if this was a
073_063_001_03_02 carrying away & not a taking , what a taking was ; and
073_063_001_03_03 that such an one if asked in any of these Cases ,
073_063_001_03_04 Did the Thief carry
073_063_001_03_05 Is the Man carrying the Goods away ? would either
073_063_001_03_06 be apt to say , no ; take them he did , but he was
073_063_001_03_07 seized before he could carry them away . |||
073_063_001_03_08 On the negative side I find neither
073_063_001_03_09 Decision nor Opinion .
073_063_001_03_10 I have drawn the Line of Consummation
073_063_001_03_11 at this stage of the guilty Process , because ' twas at
073_063_001_03_12 this that I thought it would be most conspicuous
073_063_001_03_13 and least liable to Controversy . If not , let there be
073_063_001_03_14 supposed some Period posterior to and distinct from the
073_063_001_03_15 " taking " and let it be called the " carrying away " #
073_063_001_03_16 Now carrying away must be from some place
073_063_001_03_17 by
073_063_001_03_18 to some other : but to settle the explanatory Aphorisms
073_063_001_03_19 the Limits between these two Places in every Case that
073_063_001_03_20 might occur would lead into endless Difficulties and
073_063_001_03_21 Disenssions ; and to leave it to the Jury in every
073_063_001_03_22 Case without any such Direction would induce great
073_063_001_03_23 Fluctuation of in & Uncertainty in the Decisions

073_069_001_03_01 For Examples in Proof of this , to avoid tedious
073_069_001_03_02 Details , I must be content to refer myself to the
073_069_001_03_03 Reader ' s Imagination .
073_069_001_03_04 The inserting Aphorisms concerning them
073_069_001_03_05 in the popular Code would have a mischievous
073_069_001_03_06 Consequence , if any ; in as much as it would
073_069_001_03_07 serve to point out to Malefactors the precautions
073_069_001_03_08 conducive to their Security .
073_069_001_03_09 4th Without the Consent of him who
073_069_001_03_10 has , or of any acting one on his Behalf
073_069_001_03_11 This is inserted for the sake of distinguishing
073_069_001_03_12 the Crime in Question as well from Embezzlement
073_069_001_03_13 as from the several Kinds of Frauds .
073_069_001_03_14 How these are respectively distinguished from
073_069_001_03_15 each other will be seen in its proper place .
073_069_001_03_16 5th In the Intention of making it
073_069_001_03_17 his own .
073_069_001_03_18 I believe this Expression will be deemed less
073_069_001_03_19 equivocal than another which I had under Consideration ;
073_069_001_03_20 viz : " converting it to his own use " which latter
073_069_001_03_21 might in strictness perhaps be used of a Man
073_069_001_03_22 who took away any Utensil of his Neighbour ' s tho '

071_139_003_04_01 that the punishment shall outweigh the profit
071_139_003_04_02 of the Offence . [ See Ch : ( Proposition ) Rule . the Punish=
071_139_003_04_03 : ment for wrongfully wasting or usurping a
071_139_003_04_04 thing of the same sort bona fide or under colour
071_139_003_04_05 of title would be the being obliged to pay the
071_139_003_04_06 price set upon it by the Judge , which pro=
071_139_003_04_07 : bably might be no more than the ordinary
071_139_003_04_08 marketable price . On the other hand the profit
071_139_003_04_09 of the offence if the thing were wasted or destroy=
071_139_003_04_10 : ed would be ordinarily the pleasure of male=

071_139_003_04_12 of privation you will suffer at the thoughts
071_139_003_04_13 of being deprived of the thing in question .
071_139_003_04_14 Now when the marketable price of the thing
071_139_003_04_15 is comparatively small the pleasure of male=
071_139_003_04_16 : volence may much more than outweigh the
071_139_003_04_17 pain of paying it . You have a gold ring
071_139_003_04_18 for instance the materials and workmanship
071_139_003_04_19 of which are worth a guinea ; but it contains

116_067_001_02_01 11 P 204 . April 1799 . " It having been for several days reported , that
116_067_001_02_02 " the crews of two boats , which had been permitted to go to Hunter ' s
116_067_001_02_03 " River for a load of coals , had been cut off by the natives , the
116_067_001_02_04 " governor ordered his whale boat to be well armed , and to proceed
116_067_001_02_05 " thither , in quest of the boats and their crews ; sending in her
116_067_001_02_06 " Henry Hacking , a person on whom he could depend . Upon his
116_067_001_02_07 " return he informed the governor , that on his arrival he found
116_067_001_02_08 " an attempt had been made to burn the smaller boat , which
116_067_001_02_09 " had had three men in her , who were each provided with a
116_067_001_02_10 " musquet . The boat was there , but the men were not to be
116_067_001_02_11 " found . Going immediately in search of them , he fell in with
116_067_001_02_12 " a large body of natives all armed . On desiring them to inform
116_067_001_02_13 " him what was become of the white men , they told him they
116_067_001_02_14 " were gone to Sidney . This did not satisfy him , as he found
116_067_001_02_15 " they had taken away the sails of the boats , the men ' s blankets ,
116_067_001_02_16 " and every thing that they had with them . He threatened
116_067_001_02_17 " to kill them if they did not instantly inform him , & presented
116_067_001_02_18 " his musquet at them . This they laughed at , and said , that
116_067_001_02_19 " if he did not go away , and leave them a small two-oared
116_067_001_02_20 " boat which he had brought with him , & the whale boats , they
116_067_001_02_21 " would destroy every white man there , and poised their spears in
116_067_001_02_22 " a threatening manner . He again levelled his piece at them , and
116_067_001_02_23 " snapped it without priming , in the hope of alarming them ; but
116_067_001_02_24 " they were not so easily frightened , and became more noisy and

071_002_003_04_14 any of them would be to enter upon a branch of Law fo :

071_002_003_04_16 these titles could such provisions be exhibited in terminis ,

071_133_002_04_03 committed , who they were that had been sufferers , it would not be an Of=
071_133_002_04_04 : fence against the Class as such , but so many Offences against so many
071_133_002_04_05 individuals . But nothing can more easily happen than that all the
071_133_002_04_06 members of any corporation , or sect , or political state should be defamed
071_133_002_04_07 vilified
071_133_002_04_08 or at once . So also may all the members of a particular pro=
071_133_002_04_09 : fession or trade indiscriminately be prejudiced in their professional
071_133_002_04_10 or commercial capacity ; for instance by any such practices of a per=
071_133_002_04_11 : son of the same profession or trade as are calculated to give him an
071_133_002_04_12 unfair advantage over his fellows .
071_133_002_05_01 In these cases the immediate object of the offence is the class
071_133_002_05_02 itself : but the special damage , if there is any , falls upon individu=
071_133_002_05_03 : als . Where there is no special damage therefore , the Offender can only be
071_133_002_05_04 punished criminally in behalf of the class at large : where there is spe=
071_133_002_05_05 =cial damage he may be punished civilly as well as criminally
071_133_002_05_06 in behalf as well of the class as of the particular individuals damnifi=

071_133_002_05_09 person of that persuasion
071_133_002_05_10 in consequence of the report , to any particular Jew , the Offender can
071_133_002_05_11 only be punished criminally as for defaming the Jewish Sect ; but
071_133_002_05_12 if in consequence of the defamation a mob rises and ill treats the per=
071_133_002_05_13 : sons

073_050_001_02_02 most constant & universal , is gratified in the Method of all
073_050_001_02_03 Methods the most simple , is that with which we will begin .
073_050_001_02_04 Other Offences operating on the same Subject , viz :
073_050_001_02_05 Property , fall short in point of Simplicity of this , in
073_050_001_02_06 that they are either complicated with Inquiries operating
073_050_001_02_07 XX
073_050_001_02_08 on a different Subject , viz : Person ; or else take a

073_050_001_02_13 Simple however as this is in the Mode & Principle
073_050_001_02_14 of its Perpetration there is no Offence that has in many
073_050_001_02_15 Cases the Conception of it ' s distinctive Characters more
073_050_001_02_16 intricate , nor therefore the Doctrine relative to it more
073_050_001_02_17 complicated : owing partly to what Intricacy of it ' s natural
073_050_001_02_18 Character , and partly to it ' s having been made by our
073_050_001_02_19 own Laws especially to take a different factitious one
073_050_001_02_20 from every one of a great Variety of Modifications &
073_050_001_02_21 Relations , as will be hereafter explained , of which that

071_162_001_03_01 Of Frauds relative to the Coin .
071_162_001_04_01 Introductory Observations .
071_162_001_04_02 In the mention of Frauds relative to the Coin the
071_162_001_04_03 act
071_162_001_04_04 Act of Coining naturally takes the lead : but it is the uttering
071_162_001_04_05 bad
071_162_001_04_06 of base Coin , the obtaining things of a certain Value in return
071_162_001_04_07 for a thing pretended to be of equal but which in fact is of
071_162_001_04_08 less Value , that produces all the Mischief .
071_162_001_04_09 Coining is a species of Forgery . The impression given
071_162_001_04_10 to a piece of coin is designed to answer the purpose of a dis=
071_162_001_04_11 : course to this effect ; " I the Officer in this case appointed by
071_162_001_04_12 " the Law , do certify , that the substance which you here see con=
071_162_001_04_13 : tains such or such a quantity or quantities of such or such
071_162_001_04_14 " a metal or metals . " Now in every state there are but one or
071_162_001_04_15 more particular set or sets of Officers appointed for this pur=
071_162_001_04_16 : pose . If then any person who is not of any such set takes
071_162_001_04_17 upon him to fashion any portion of matter in the view of
071_162_001_04_18 causing it to be taken for a portion of matter so stamped
071_162_001_04_19 and by such authority , or alters the quantity or quantities of
071_162_001_04_20 any

116_295_001_02_01 N . S . Wales
116_295_001_03_01 two non-expirees . These four fugitives were discovered by smoking
116_295_001_03_02 the ship , an operation , for which the consent of the master ( for
116_295_001_03_03 so it is particularly stated ) had been obtained . Of the non-expi-
116_295_001_03_04 -rees it is stated that they had not yet served the full period
116_295_001_03_05 but
116_295_001_03_06 of their sentences . From this statement it seemed reasonable to
116_295_001_03_07 inferr that even these , had they returned to England , would not
116_295_001_03_08 have been landed there till after the day at which they had
116_295_001_03_09 a right to land on British ground . Be this as it may ,
116_295_001_03_10 thus much is our doubt , that by this order the assurance
116_295_001_03_11 given in the preceding one of August 1792 was compleatly
116_295_001_03_12 violated : and that in respect of the faculty of leaving the
116_295_001_03_13 Colony , the condition of those who had a right , and those
116_295_001_03_14 who had not a right , was the same : the same under the
116_295_001_03_15 eye , and by the act of that very Governor , by whom the exist-
116_295_001_03_16 -ence of the right had not seven months before , been noticed
116_295_001_03_17 and recognized so that , by his own shewing , he kept them
116_295_001_03_18 there in defiance of the law .

116_295_001_03_20 -nifesting the sincerity of the assurance , and the manifestation is
116_295_001_03_21 of the same kind . " But few Convicts " ( meaning Expirees , says
116_295_001_03_22 Captain Collins ) " were allowed to quit the Colony in these ships :
116_295_001_03_23 by which it is evident that it was want of permission on the
116_295_001_03_24 part of the governor , and not want of room or any other
116_295_001_03_25 faculty that prevented the numbers from being greater . The
116_295_001_03_26 ships were two . On another occasion in Nov . 1794 it appears
116_295_001_03_27 that the number of Convicts received on board two ships only
116_295_001_03_28 ( the Endeavour and the Fancy ) had been near an hundred + :
116_295_001_03_29 whereof fifty by permission , fifty more without it . +

115_075_001_03_02 his said Successors shall respectively be made Debtors in their
115_075_001_03_03 quarterly account to the amount of £50 for every instance of
115_075_001_03_04 such escape , irresistible violence from without excepted : provided
115_075_001_03_05 that they shall be made Creditors to the like amount in case of

115_075_001_03_08 said Jeremy Bentham and his Successors at the rate of £100
115_075_001_03_09 a head for a proportionable premium to be paid by the said
115_075_001_03_10 Lords Commissioners and their Successors as follows . A
115_075_001_03_11 computation shall be formed of the number of deaths that may
115_075_001_03_12 be expected to take place among the Prisoners in the course of
115_075_001_03_13 each year out of the said number of a thousand prisoners
115_075_001_03_14 living at the commencement of such year , taking for the
115_075_001_03_15 standard the annual proportion of the sum total of deaths
115_075_001_03_16 at the end of a year to that of persons living at the com-
115_075_001_03_17 -mencement of the said year , according to the London Bills
115_075_001_03_18 of Mortality , and the calculations therein grounded by the late
115_075_001_03_19 Revd . Dr . Price . Such computation being made , the said
115_075_001_03_20 Jeremy Bentham and his Successors shall at the end of
115_075_001_03_21 each year be on the one hand be made Creditors to the

096_003_002_01_02 what are called causes & effects in the
096_003_002_01_03 natural world : and therefore that
096_003_002_01_04 as in the latter case from this expe :
096_003_002_01_05 : rience we are allowed to infer , that
096_003_002_01_06 such a cause will produce such an
096_003_002_01_07 effect , so in the moral world , we
096_003_002_01_08 &
096_003_002_01_09 may infer , that at all times the
096_003_002_01_10 among all men , the same motives ,
096_003_002_01_11 & the same circumstances supposed ,
096_003_002_01_12 the same actions will follow . Even
096_003_002_01_13 this will not be sufficient to justify our
096_003_002_01_14 Author ' s assertion that man must
096_003_002_01_15 inevitably & in all things obey
096_003_002_01_16 the Will of his Creator , unless he
096_003_002_01_17 supposes too that the Creator has
096_003_002_01_18 placed every man in such circum-
096_003_002_01_19 : stances , that the motives to obedience
096_003_002_01_20 must be always present , and always
096_003_002_01_21 effectual . And if he assert that ,
096_003_002_01_22 our question recurs with equal
096_003_002_01_23 force _ To what purpose a System
096_003_002_01_24 of Laws ? And if he does not suppose this ,
096_003_002_01_25 it is absurd to apply the term of Law to motion
096_003_002_01_26 gravitation & , in the same sense as he
096_003_002_01_27 applies it to the moral conduct of an intelligent
096_003_002_01_28 Being .

115_111_001_02_01 upon the occasion , it only gives Mr Bentham
115_111_001_02_02 for his Penitentiary Plan , and that for a single
115_111_001_02_03 year in one case , and for two years in another ,
115_111_001_02_04 what it is now giving to Mr Campbell , and
115_111_001_02_05 would continue to be giving to him otherwise , for
115_111_001_02_06 his Hulk Plan .
115_111_001_02_07 Mr Ford assumes , as it was very natural for him
115_111_001_02_08 to do , that of the £27,000 , £15,000 was for the
115_111_001_02_09 Building , since £15,000 is the difference between the
115_111_001_02_10 £27,000 ( the sum demanded for the first year / and
115_111_001_02_11 £12,000 ( the sum demanded for every subsequent year
115_111_001_02_12 for the 1000 Prisoners / : and an inference equally natural
115_111_001_02_13 was , that , as Government had paid that sum once
115_111_001_02_14 for the Building to Mr Bentham , it should not
115_111_001_02_15 have to pay that sum over again to his Represen-
115_111_001_02_16 -tatives . But no such line of distinction was ever
115_111_001_02_17 drawn on either side till now . Mr Bentham ' s pro-
115_111_001_02_18 -position was _ " Land with a fixed price to it has
115_111_001_02_19 been appropriated to the purpose of a Penitentiary
115_111_001_02_20 " House _ You give Mr Campbell £27,000 for every
115_111_001_02_21 " year for maintaining Prisoners on the Hulk Plan _
115_111_001_02_22 " Give me that sum for the first year only , I will
115_111_001_02_23 " buy the Land , I will find Buildings , &c . and for every
115_111_001_02_24 " year I will maintain the same number for £12,000 .
115_111_001_02_25 " Here then you have the Penitentiary Plan for the
115_111_001_02_26 " first year at no more than the expence of the

072_212_001_04_03 regarding the taking of it is not Theft although in
072_212_001_04_04 strictness he has no right to take it
072_212_001_04_05 A thing may be supposed to appeared to a man to
072_212_001_04_06 be of a value to be not worth regarding : if it be such

072_212_001_04_08 ask him and be at the trouble of taking it
072_212_001_04_09 As a handful of blackberries or hedgenuts in a country where
072_212_001_04_10 it is not customary for the occupier of the land to make a profit
072_212_001_04_11 of such articles
072_212_001_04_12 When the value of a thing is very inconsiderable
072_212_001_04_13 although it should appear to have been once occupied a
072_212_001_04_14 slight circumstance will make it appear as if the owner had
072_212_001_04_15 meant to abandon it when perhaps in reality it was of con :
072_212_001_04_16 : siderable value and he never meant to do so
072_212_001_04_17 for
072_212_001_04_18 As if a Promisory note of a considerable sum should by
072_212_001_04_19 accident have happened to be blown out at a window : merely

116_131_001_01_01 Before any instructitions were received for stopping
116_131_001_01_02 any body those who had no right to depart or those who
116_131_001_01_03 were
116_131_001_01_04 had a right _ those who had a right as well as those
116_131_001_01_05 who had none , flogged , on their attempting to go , as well
116_131_001_01_06 as stopped . But when the authority came for stopping
116_131_001_01_07 eve every body then came the general promise to those
116_131_001_01_08 who had a right to depart giving the liberty of
116_131_001_01_09 departure to all accompanied with a secret intention of
116_131_001_01_10 refusing it to all but a few , then came the general
116_131_001_01_11 promise to stop nobody I mean of those who had any
116_131_001_01_12 right to go accompanied with a determination to
116_131_001_01_13 stop all but a few favorites . The difference was that
116_131_001_01_14 now after receipt of the authority for stopping them
116_131_001_01_15 though most who either asked leave or without asking
116_131_001_01_16 attempted to get away were stopped yet it does not
116_131_001_01_17 appear that any more were flogged for it . But if
116_131_001_01_18 even the number of them whose right of departure had
116_131_001_01_19 revived had accumulated to its greatest multitude
116_131_001_01_20 there was no end of flogging to prevent the exercise
116_131_001_01_21 of it it shews how far any such illegal punishment
116_131_001_01_22 was from being necessary even to this illegal purpose
116_131_001_01_23 when there were so few of these that is when it

115_110_001_02_02 " a Contract between the Lords of the Treasury
115_110_001_02_03 " and Jer . Bentham Esq : for building a

115_110_001_02_06 to be made to Mr Bentham ' s Representatives .
115_110_001_02_07 _ together with Mr Bentham ' s answer .
115_110_001_03_01 As this Article now stands , after the decease
115_110_001_03_02 of Mr B . & his Successor , Government are to
115_110_001_03_03 pay Mr B ' s Representatives for all the Buildings ,
115_110_001_03_04 Stock , &c upon the premises , notwithstanding
115_110_001_03_05 15
115_110_001_03_06 Government supply a large sum , viz : £13,000
115_110_001_03_07 towards such Building on the commencement of
115_110_001_03_08 the undertaking , and eventually a much larger
115_110_001_03_09 sum , by paying him 18 for every person
115_110_001_03_10 committed to his care , above the stipulated number
115_110_001_03_11 of 1000 , for the express purpose of providing an
115_110_001_03_12 habitation and enlarging his premises . This ap-
115_110_001_03_13 -pears much too hard upon Government , and it
115_110_001_03_14 would be fairer to let that matter be referred to
115_110_001_03_15 Arbitrators , one to be chosen by Government ,
115_110_001_03_16 the other by Mr B ' s Representatives , with
115_110_001_03_17 power for them to choose an Umpire in case
115_110_001_03_18 of a variance in Opinion . Such Arbitrators
115_110_001_03_19 to
116_244_001_01_01 be eager to
116_244_001_01_02 which some would is - that there ought to be no
116_244_001_01_03 Minister in England : my inference is that there ought
116_244_001_01_04 to be a Minister in Norfolk Island . In Norfolk Island
116_244_001_01_05 - yes and in New South Wales as many Ministers
116_244_001_01_06 as congregations . No Minister , no congregation :
116_244_001_01_07 the wisdom , if good in any one place , will be act
116_244_001_01_08 less good in many others . And if Ministers why
116_244_001_01_09 not Bishops ? I mean in process of time : though
116_244_001_01_10 for New South Wales as for Man and British
116_244_001_01_11 I suppose might
116_244_001_01_12 America , for some time one envy same . Suppose
116_244_001_01_13 for example our Lord the late Bishop of Rochester
116_244_001_01_14 lately translated to was to be translated
116_244_001_01_15 still higher to Paramatta ? The more arduous the
116_244_001_01_16 task the greater the glory : he might then promote
116_244_001_01_17 in peace and quietness that reformation which with a

071_112_001_03_01 Of Family Imposture
071_112_001_04_01 Instances have sometimes happened where , from
071_112_001_04_02 the influence of some caprice or other , children have been chang=
071_112_001_04_03 =ed at Nurse . The Nurse has thought herself unable to provide
071_112_001_04_04 for her own child : or from motives of vanity has wished to see
071_112_001_04_05 it brought up in a condition superior to her own .
071_112_001_04_06 Quest . 1 . Why Family Imposture is punished with
071_112_001_04_07 perpetual Punishment ?
071_112_001_04_08 Reasons
071_112_001_04_09 1 . Because as the profit as well as mischief of the Offence
071_112_001_04_10 may be indefinite , so ought the punishment in order to be
071_112_001_04_11 upon a par with it . See Tit . [ Proportion ] Rule 1 . There is no
071_112_001_04_12 calculating the confusion and distress that may be brought
071_112_001_04_13 upon a family when an impostor has introduced himself in=
071_112_001_04_14 : to it , and afterwards comes to be discovered . The dissipation
071_112_001_04_15 of the whole fortune of the person whom he supplants or
071_112_001_04_16 counterfeits is one only amongst a multitude of evils . The
071_112_001_04_17 Tearing alliances asunder and foreign family affections into

071_112_001_05_02 that she liked the counterfeit husband better than the real . This happened in
071_112_001_05_03 France . The Story is in the Causes Celebres .

116_063_001_02_01 P.27 - March 1797 . " However unpleasant it was to the governor , that
116_063_001_02_02 " the lives of so many of these people should have been taken , no other
116_063_001_02_03 " course could possibly be pursued ; for it was their custom , when
116_063_001_02_04 " they found themselves more numerous and better armed than
116_063_001_02_05 " the white people , to demand with insolence whatever they wanted ; and ,
116_063_001_02_06 " if refused , to have recourse to murder . This check , it was hoped ,
116_063_001_02_07 " would have a good effect ; and presumably , who had received seven
116_063_001_02_08 " buck shots in his head and different parts of his body , was taken
116_063_001_02_09 " extremely ill to the hospital . This man was first known in the
116_063_001_02_10 " settlement by the murder of John McIntire in the year 1790 ;
116_063_001_02_11 " since which he had been a most active enemy to the settlers ,
116_063_001_02_12 " plundering them of their property , and endangering their personal
116_063_001_02_13 " safety " .
116_063_001_02_14 P.31 - April 1797 . The natives at the Hawkesbury were at this
116_063_001_02_15 " time very troublesome , burning a dwelling house and a stack
116_063_001_02_16 " of wheat belonging to a settler there , after having plundered him
116_063_001_02_17 " of all his other possessions . "
116_063_001_02_18 April 1797
116_063_001_02_19 P.32 - . Pemulwuy .. . saw and spoke with one of the gentlemen
116_063_001_02_20 " of the party ; enquiring of him whether the governor was
116_063_001_02_21 angry , " and seemed pleased at being told that he was not : not-
116_063_001_02_22 - " withstanding which , there could be but little doubt , that this
116_063_001_02_23 " savage brutal dispostion would manifest itself whenever excited
116_063_001_02_24 by the appearance of an unarmed man " .
116_063_001_02_25 P.33 - May 1797 . " Notwithstanding the example which had lately
116_063_001_02_26 " been made of the natives , they were exceedingly troublesome to the
116_063_001_02_27 " settlers in Lane-Cove , burning a house and felling some hogs belong-
116_063_001_02_28 - " ing to one of them . This was certainly committing a wanton injury ;
116_063_001_02_29 " for neither the burnt house , nor the slaughtered animals , which
116_063_001_02_30 " they left on the spot , could be of any benefit to them . At
116_063_001_02_31 Kissing Point , another district , they dangerously wounded a
116_063_001_02_32 " settler & his wife , first burning every article belonging to them .
116_063_001_02_33 " The settlers in Lane Cove were so much so perpetually alarmed
116_063_001_02_34 " by their people , that they collected their whole force , and , a few
116_063_001_02_35 " soldiers being sent to their assistance , went out in the night ;
116_063_001_02_36 " and , being directed by their fires to the place where they lay ,
116_063_001_02_37 " they discovered a large body of natives , collected , no doubt , for the pur-
116_063_001_02_38 - " pose of attacking and plundering the settlers , Being unwilling to take
116_063_001_02_39 " any of their lives , a volley of musketry was fired over the heads ,

072_049_004_04_12 enemies as laying aside their hostile disposition for a

072_049_004_04_15 the most common is a flag , called a flag of truce . In
072_049_004_04_16 all these cases what the Law has to do is to constitute
072_049_004_04_17 this circumstance an aggravation applicable to the seve=

072_049_004_04_21 this
072_049_004_04_22 circumstanced , is evident enough ; the tendency of such
072_049_004_04_23 denial is to perpetuate the miseries of war .

071_192_004_04_02 Sometimes indeed Insolvents are discharged ; but this is

071_192_004_04_04 In a Law of this kind neither the delinquency nor the suffering

071_186_003_04_01 that he was never to be trusted ; that he had put off his habits
071_186_003_04_02 of industry , if he ever had any , and lost his talents for want of
071_186_003_04_03 exercise ; and in a word that he was become totally irresponsible .
071_186_003_04_04 With a Coiner the case is very different . The very talent which
071_186_003_04_05 fits a man for practising this ingenious though dishonest spe=
071_186_003_04_06 : cies of industry is a kind of fund of responsibility of which
071_186_003_04_07 the very punishment that marks his crime will certify
071_186_003_04_08 him to be in possession . It will at the same time be a
071_186_003_04_09 pledge of his future good behaviour with respect to offences
071_186_003_04_10 of mere indigence : since while he possesses it he is enabled
071_186_003_04_11 commonly to make such a profit at 1 a place where he is

071_186_003_04_14 may get at one place as well as at another such low

071_186_003_04_17 extraordinary wages that are given for such ingenious

071_186_003_04_19 gave way ,

071_181_002_04_01 Now that such a case will often happen has been shewn . It
071_181_002_04_02 will often happen therefore that a man will be found who will
071_181_002_04_03 unwillingly accept the counterfeit Coin , and if it stays upon
071_181_002_04_04 his hands be a sufferer by it . This is the only point in the
071_181_002_04_05 case that is material ; whether , in default of an inducement
071_181_002_04_06 which is always present somewhere or other and always ad=
071_181_002_04_07 =equate , there would be such or such another inducement , is
071_181_002_04_08 a question altogether immaterial with a view to practice . If
071_181_002_04_09 there be any one single man in the nation who will accept
071_181_002_04_10 the counterfeit Coin , the mischief is as effectually incurred and
071_181_002_04_11 that mischief is as great , as if there were ten thousand who
071_181_002_04_12 would take it . It could ultimately fall upon no more than
071_181_002_04_13 some one person in the former case , and that does equally
071_181_002_04_14 in the latter .
071_181_002_04_15 2 The alarm is perhaps not always quite so great where
071_181_002_04_16 foreign Coin is counterfeited or diminished as where a like inju=

071_181_002_04_19 know of it are not necessarily alarmed at it ; but all people
071_181_002_04_20 are who may have occasion to accept the counterfeit foreign
071_181_002_04_21 Coin .

116_649_001_03_02 Mr MacKintosh ' s speech _ It was the moral anger of disinterested spec-
116_649_001_03_03 -tators against atrocious crimes , the gravest and most dignified moral
116_649_001_03_04 principle which the God of Justice has implanted in the human heart ,
116_649_001_03_05 that of which the dread is the only restraint on the actions of powerful
116_649_001_03_06 criminals , & of which the promulgation is the only punishment
116_649_001_03_07 that can be inflicted on them . It is a restraint which ought
116_649_001_03_08 not to be weakened _ it is a punishment no good man
116_649_001_03_09 can desire to mitigate .
116_649_001_03_10 H . 166 I hope I may venture to say , that no English assembly need
116_649_001_03_11 have endured such a sacrifice of eternal justice to any miserable interest
116_649_001_03_12 of an hour .
116_649_001_03_13 H . 167 . If there be a decorum due to exalted rank and authority ,
116_649_001_03_14 there is also a much more sacred decorum due to virtue +
116_649_001_03_15 to human nature , which would be outraged & trampled under
116_649_001_03_16 foot , by speaking of guilt in a lukewarm language language ,
116_649_001_03_17 falsely called moderate .

116_649_001_03_19 animated by the moral approbation with which they can survey
116_649_001_03_20 their sentiments towards others , who are ennobled in their own
116_649_001_03_21 eyes by a consciousness that they are fighting for justice as well
116_649_001_03_22 as well as interest , a consciousness which non can feel , but those

116_618_001_02_01 Letter 3d
116_618_001_03_01 Would Your Lordship have supposed it ? - It is
116_618_001_03_02 upon the very merits _ the acknowledged or at any
116_618_001_03_03 rate the alledged merits , of the Penitentiary system ,
116_618_001_03_04 in these its less perfect forms , that the hostility
116_618_001_03_05 to it in its more perfect form has grounded itself .
116_618_001_03_06 So well has the system succeeded in this and
116_618_001_03_07 that Count Country , that for that very reason there
116_618_001_03_08 is to be none for England : so well has it suc-
116_618_001_03_09 -ceeded upon a small scale , that it is not to
116_618_001_03_10 scale
116_618_001_03_11 be suffered to shew itself upon a large one : _
116_618_001_03_12 so well have the existing prisons succeeded at
116_618_001_03_13 an enormous rate of expence , that for that
116_618_001_03_14 very reason a still better prison is not to
116_618_001_03_15 be suffered to be built at a tenth a fifteenth
116_618_001_03_16 or a twentieth part of that expence . So peremptory
116_618_001_03_17 was the determination to cover the country with
116_618_001_03_18 prisons unthought of by Parliament , that
116_618_001_03_19 it is for that very reason it was determined not
116_618_001_03_20 to have the one prison , that had so long ago and
116_618_001_03_21 so repeatedly been prescribed by Parliament . _
116_618_001_03_22 The conclusion made by the patrons pa-
116_618_001_03_23 -trons and organizers of the most improved of
116_618_001_03_24 all these improved prisons has been somewhat
116_618_001_03_25 different . Yes , my Lord : It is among the most dis-
116_618_001_03_26 -tinguished of its rivals , that the Panopticon plan
116_618_001_03_27 has ever found the most cordial of its well-wishers _
116_618_001_03_28 the most generous of its supporters . _

115_072_001_02_17 the said Buildings shall be readiness for the reception of the said
115_072_001_02_18 number of Convicts , three weeks notice at the least having
115_072_001_02_19 been given of such readiness on the part of the said Jeremy

115_078_002_02_15 reduction shall constitute the supplemental allowance to which
115_078_002_02_16 the said Jeremy Bentham or his Representatives shall be
115_078_002_02_17 intitled as aforesaid . Provided also that if in respect thereof any
115_078_002_02_18 dispute should arise , the same shall be settled by two Referees , one
115_078_002_02_19 to be appointed by each of the parties to these presents , with pow-
115_078_002_02_20 -er to choose an umpire .
115_078_002_02_21 Art.4 . And Whereas it may chance that at or after the time when the
115_078_002_02_22 said Jeremy Bentham shall be in readiness to receive the said number of
115_078_002_02_23 1000 Convicts as aforesaid , there may be more than one thousand such Con-
115_078_002_02_24 -victs which under the powers of the said Act might be committed to his
115_078_002_02_25 charge , it is moreover agreed that he the said Jeremy Bentham shall
115_078_002_02_26 of £12 a year
115_078_002_02_27 receive every such supernumerary Convict on the same terms per head
115_078_002_02_28 as the herein abovementioned original number of 1000 with the addition
115_078_002_02_29 of only £18 per head payable the half thereof on the reception of each
115_078_002_02_30 supernumerary and the other half on that day twelvemonth clear of
115_078_002_02_31 all deductions with interest in case of arrear as herein abovementioned .
115_078_002_02_32 which said addition of £18 shall be in lieu of all expenses touching
115_078_002_02_33 the providing buildings and other accommodations for the reception of
115_078_002_02_34 every such supernumerary . Provided that such addition after having
115_078_002_02_35 been once paid for any such supernumerary , shall not be paid for
115_078_002_02_36 any other such supernumerary , except in as far as the total number of
115_078_002_02_37 e
115_078_002_02_38 such supernumeraries reckoning from the first shall be encreased by y reception of

071_192_002_03_01 Of Culpable Insolvency
071_192_002_04_01 Innocent or culpable , culpable in a less degree or in a greater
071_192_002_04_02 degree , it makes no difference .
071_192_002_04_03 It puts innocence upon a worse footing than criminality .
071_192_002_04_04 It invites men to commit crimes . If a man steals he may be
071_192_002_04_05 whipped or sent to live at large in another country for , Seven
071_192_002_04_06 Years , or be confined to work for two or three Years . If he
071_192_002_04_07 borrows , he may be confined for life .
071_192_002_04_08 All the while care is taken not to ask the debtor a=
071_192_002_04_09 : bout his effects : that would be an easy and natural way of
071_192_002_04_10 coming at them , which the Common Law abhors . This is ow=
071_192_002_04_11 : ing to excess of tenderness : it would be a hardship to him
071_192_002_04_12 to oblige him to tell any thing which he does not like
071_192_002_04_13 to tell : it would be like making him confess himself a
071_192_002_04_14 criminal : to save this it punishes him worse than if he
071_192_002_04_15 were .
071_192_002_04_16 To make amends for the oppression thus exercised upon
071_192_002_04_17 the Debtor , the Law extends it to the Creditor . It seems an=
071_192_002_04_18 ( a )
071_192_002_04_19 : gry with him for making use of the only miserable remedy

071_192_002_05_01 Note
071_192_002_05_02 [ ( a ) Only ] I am speaking all along , it is to be remembered , of the case where
071_192_002_05_03 the property is not visible . Where it is there is no need either of Imprison
071_192_002_05_04 ment or examination .
096_098_003_01_01 such
096_098_003_01_02 an one enacted by any Legislator .
096_098_003_01_03 In the former Case , it will be either kept
096_098_003_01_04 or broken : if broken , there is an Unhappiness
096_098_003_01_05 produced by the Punishment [ which forms ] the
096_098_003_01_06 sanction : if kept , men are kept from doing what
096_098_003_01_07 they have a Mind to do : now to be kept from
096_098_003_01_08 doing what one has a Mind to do , is Unhappiness . ||
096_098_003_01_09 To instance at once the strongest Case that
096_098_003_01_10 can be put in Contradiction ; the Case of a Law
096_098_003_01_11 Now
096_098_003_01_12 against Murder : laying out of Consideration for a
096_098_003_01_13 moment the Unhappiness it prevents to a Person
096_098_003_01_14 who without it would be murder ' d , his Friends , &
096_098_003_01_15 the Community , as likewise at the long run to
096_098_003_01_16 the Person who would murder ; it is evident it
096_098_003_01_17 produces for the present a Quantity of Unhappiness
096_098_003_01_18 in the latter person _ the Unhappiness concomitant
096_098_003_01_19 on Restraint _ the Unhappiness of being obliged
096_098_003_01_20 to give up the Pleasure of satiating the keen
096_098_003_01_21 Appetites of Avarice or Revenge .
096_098_003_01_22 therefore
096_098_003_01_23 How little soever it seems to have been
096_098_003_01_24 attended to , whenever therefore a Legislator makes
096_098_003_01_25 +
096_098_003_01_26 a Law , he may be perfectly certain he is doing

071_120_001_05_03 ( B )
071_120_001_05_04 a man is concerned in conveying a person against his will
071_120_001_05_05 to a place beyond sea or out of the dominions of the state ;
071_120_001_05_06 knowing himself to have no right so to do , and intend=
071_120_001_05_07 : ing not to be amenable to Law .

071_120_001_05_12 Punishment
071_120_001_05_13 For kidnapping the Offender ' s punishment shall
071_120_001_05_14 be as follows .
071_120_001_05_15 1 . He may be punished as for Simple personal Injuries
071_120_001_05_16 2 . He may be banished from , or confined to , the whole or
071_120_001_05_17 any part of his native or any other country for any time
071_120_001_05_18 not more than that during which the party injured conti=
071_120_001_05_19 : nued to suffer in his Liberty by means of the offence .
071_120_001_05_20 3 . Instead
096_052_003_01_01 Law in General ( 7
096_052_003_02_01 the thing that was to be called a Law there was any thing to be ex-
096_052_003_02_02 pressed : at the same time that as no particular mode of expres-
096_052_003_02_03 sion was specified by it , it might serve to give an intimation of
096_052_003_02_04 I know not what obscure sort of an appointment , without expres-
096_052_003_02_05 -sion , where there was nothing to be expressed .
096_052_003_02_06 The four other words , Rule , Superior , inferior , obey , are all calcula-
096_052_003_02_07 -ted to favour the deceit : The word Rule as we have seen by the loose-
096_052_003_02_08 -ness of it ' s meaning : The words " superior , " " inferior " by meaning no-
096_052_003_02_09 -thing applicable to the purpose , but what is meant without them ,
096_052_003_02_10 u
096_052_003_02_11 and the word " obey , " by sq inting at a sort of no meaning [ which is ]
096_052_003_02_12 which
096_052_003_02_13 corresponding to that of the word " prescribe , " and is to be produced _
096_052_003_02_14 occasionally instead of it ' s genuine and intelligible meaning corres-
096_052_003_02_15 -pondent to that of the genuine meaning of the same word .
096_052_003_02_16 The import they ought to have in order to be true in this place we
096_052_003_02_17 have already given .
096_052_003_02_18 To Obey , is to do what is prescribed : what has been said therefore
096_052_003_02_19 on the occasion of that word may be applied without repeating it , to
096_052_003_02_20 to this . What is " prescribed " says our Author himself , " must be noti-
096_052_003_02_21 -fied " to those who are to obey it . " Those therefore who are to Obey must
096_052_003_02_22 be such to whom notification can be made : Beings that have ideas :
096_052_003_02_23 beings that have will : beings that have understanding to apprehend
096_052_003_02_24 the expression of another ' s will : beings that act from such motives
096_052_003_02_25 as operate on Will : the expectation I mean of pain or pleasure .
096_052_003_02_26 Lastly as to the word " bound " : so far is it from being of use to define
096_052_003_02_27 the
096_052_003_03_01 Sect . I . Law in General . ( 7

096_100_001_02_01 In all these five Cases the Law is simply and
096_100_001_02_02 absolutely inexpedient _ there ought to be no Law
096_100_001_02_03 matter .
096_100_001_02_04 at all upon the Subject .
096_100_001_02_05 6.th Where the Act prohibited is such as does produce
096_100_001_02_06 Unhappiness in the Community but the Punish-
096_100_001_02_07 -ment , tho ' it ' s Infliction were certain , is insufficient ,
096_100_001_02_08 pain
096_100_001_02_09 the Misery of it being less than the profit of the
096_100_001_02_10 Crime .
096_100_001_02_11 Here also the Law is inexpedient _ The
096_100_001_02_12 Misery of the Crime remaining undiminished ,
096_100_001_02_13 in
096_100_001_02_14 receives by way of Addition to it the Misery of the
096_100_001_02_15 Punishment ; and the Law is the more inexpedient ,
096_100_001_02_16 by how much less the Misery of the second falls
096_100_001_02_17 short of the Misery of the first , so that it does
096_100_001_02_18 not equal it .
096_100_001_02_19 As if there were a Law , that he who robs on
096_100_001_02_20 fined
096_100_001_02_21 the Highway shall be paid one third of what he
096_100_001_02_22 takes _ The Traveller would suffer just as much
096_100_001_02_23 with this Law as without it : the Robber , if convicted ,
096_100_001_02_24 would have nothing to do but to pay his third and
096_100_001_02_25 go off quietly with the Remainder .

071_105_003_04_08 is prossecuted , public notice shall be given for any other woman

071_105_003_04_12 to their circumstances , to such provision as he can make
071_105_003_04_13 for them : but in the mean time a temporary provision
071_105_003_04_14 shall be made for the woman in question . And if there ap=

096_118_001_01_17 is fleeting and variable ; as his Recollection of them
096_118_001_01_18 when passed is hasty and incomplete ; his Inferences
096_118_001_01_19 from Analogy of the Similarity in Kind and Degree
096_118_001_01_20 of those made by the same Objects in other men ,
096_118_001_01_21 incomplete
096_118_001_01_22 hazarded & of uncertain Verity ; as the Causes assigned
096_118_001_01_23 to them from among those Objects are apt to be

115_012_001_01_08 the insurance of their lives , for an ordinary
115_012_001_01_09 that
115_012_001_01_10 premium : and at a rate grounded on an

115_107_001_01_03 the lives of the Prisoners .
115_107_001_01_04 -ing it .
115_107_001_01_05 Principle will be found to concur with precedent in recommend
115_107_001_01_06 Under the article the Governor gets a small annual pre-
115_107_001_01_07 -mium for every prisoner kept alive : paying for every one
115_107_001_01_08 who dies a heavy fine ; and this without proof of deliquency
115_107_001_01_09 or possibility of evasion .
115_107_001_01_10 The nature of things does not afford another expedient
115_107_001_01_11 of equal efficacy for effecting that intimacy of union between
115_107_001_01_12 between interest and duty the want of which has been the
115_107_001_01_13 cause
115_107_001_01_14 sole and universally acknowledged of the miseries and
115_107_001_01_15 abuses which have been so notoriously prevalent in prisons .
115_107_001_01_16 It applies to this purpose the united powers of
115_107_001_01_17 reward and punishment , without the expence of the
115_107_001_01_18 one or the hardship of the other : at the same time
115_107_001_01_19 that , so far as punishment is concerned , it produces its
115_107_001_01_20 effect with that degree of certainty with which nothing
115_107_001_01_21 that goes by that name and is administered as such
115_107_001_01_22 can ever be attended with . Legal penalties can attack only
115_107_001_01_23 upon specific acts : upon the wounding , starving or poi
115_107_001_01_24 soning men outright . _ They afford very little security
115_107_001_01_25 against destructive habits : against the being killed by
115_107_001_01_26 inches or by neglect : worn out by want of rest or nou-
115_107_001_01_27 -rishment : poisoned by bad provisions or unwholesome
115_107_001_01_28 trades and occupations .

071_010_002_03_01 Of Excuses Extenuations
071_010_002_04_01 heedlessness is to a want of consciousness . See Excuses 1 .
071_010_002_04_02 Heedlessness consists in the not being conscious of a ma=
071_010_002_04_03 : terial circumstance which really exists , where there are
071_010_002_04_04 good or probable grounds for suspecting it to exist .
071_010_002_04_05 Rashness consists in the supposing a circumstance
071_010_002_04_06 which , had it existed , would have been material to
071_010_002_04_07 exist where there were no good or probable grounds
071_010_002_04_08 for supposing it to exist entertaining such a supposition .

071_010_002_04_13 either to the matter of fact or the matter of Law . It res=

073_003_002_01_02 how
073_003_002_01_03 it as if a Man were less concerned to know his
073_003_002_01_04 Estate was disposed of effectually by something which
073_003_002_01_05 is called Equity , than how it was disposed of in-
073_003_002_01_06 -effectually by something which is called Law .
073_003_002_01_07 that
073_003_002_01_08 In Conclusion , if it be true the Use of
073_003_002_01_09 Language is , not to furnish Terms for a Man to
073_003_002_01_10 shelter himself under , while he causes others to go
073_003_002_01_11 astray , but to imprint Ideas on the Minds of those
073_003_002_01_12 to whom it is addressed , conformable to the Truth of
073_003_002_01_13 Things : we may venture to establish it as an uni-
073_003_002_01_14 -versal and inviolable Rule , for those who mean to
073_003_002_01_15 give the Reality , without contenting themselves
073_003_002_01_16 with the delusive shadow of Right Instruction , never
073_003_002_01_17 to give the Law without the Equity which controls it ,
073_003_002_01_18 nor the Common Law without the Statute which
073_003_002_01_19 has altered it , nor the Letter without the Practice
073_003_002_01_20 which modifies it into Effect .
096_015_002_01_01 they mistook an exception to a general rule , for the
096_015_002_01_02 general rule itself : & then thought themselves justi
096_015_002_01_03 of
096_015_002_01_04 -fied in dispossessing the infidels of Lands in which
096_015_002_01_05 they were in rightful possession Upon the same
096_015_002_01_06 principle this author in another place : that on the
096_015_002_01_07 conquest of an infidel country , the conquered have
096_015_002_01_08 nations
096_015_002_01_09 less rights than other conquer in the same predicament .
096_015_002_02_01 Note
096_015_002_02_02 cannot mistake nor
096_015_002_02_03 The intelligent reader will easily perceive & the candid
096_015_002_02_04 reader misinterpret my meaning . _ I am not examining
096_015_002_02_05 the validity nor the fitness of the laws of Revelation . I am
096_015_002_02_06 only exposing the abuses of it men who misapply
096_015_002_02_07 them , & give them an extension beyond what their
096_015_002_02_08 Author intended and the examples above cited
096_015_002_02_09 will prove that these abuses have been productive
096_015_002_02_10 of the greatest mischiefs , & would be so again , if
096_015_002_02_11 Men of the Authors turn of mind hold the reins of government
096_015_002_02_12 in a conquering state

116_405_004_01_08 such lamps as are extinguished . The Watchmen
116_405_004_01_09 should keep an eye to the lamps in his district ,

116_636_002_02_01 to bring Convicts to this Hulk . In the first instance
116_636_002_02_02 with this unpaid Jailer : in the next place , with
116_636_002_02_03 an unpaid gentleman _ with a gentleman to whom
116_636_002_02_04 because there were unpaid gentlemen to whom such
116_636_002_02_05 intelligence would ( it was known ) be as interesting ,
116_636_002_02_06 as to the so well paid gentlemen it would have been
116_636_002_02_07 indifferent , if not worse than indifferent , the inform-
116_636_002_02_08 -ation was addressed . I speak of Mr Neild , a second
116_636_002_02_09 Howard , who with all the zeal , with all the munifi-
116_636_002_02_10 -cence , and more than all the gentleness of his il-
116_636_002_02_11 -lustrious predecessor , has spoken the word _ has started
116_636_002_02_12 noble game , and caused the mask of humanity to
116_636_002_02_13 fall off from faces of higher rank , than those of
116_636_002_02_14 the subordinate tyrants , whom it fell to the lot of
116_636_002_02_15 his predecessor to hunt out of their holes . _
116_636_002_02_16 A private gentleman could point to Lord Pel-
116_636_002_02_17 -ham ' s office : it required a Member of Parliament ,
116_636_002_02_18 if not two , to force the intrenchments of it . Mortality
116_636_002_02_19 ( says one of those to whom this humane Jailor ' s Letter
116_636_002_02_20 in
116_636_002_02_21 had been shewn ) mortality is raging the Hulks : Sir
116_636_002_02_22 Henry Mildmay _ Mr Neild _ were it but possible _ would
116_636_002_02_23 look at it . The visit not being to be prevented , nothing
116_636_002_02_24 was left to persons in office ( Gentlemen or Noble Lords
116_636_002_02_25 I know not exactly which ) but to be delighted with
116_636_002_02_26 it .
116_636_002_02_27 it
116_636_002_02_28 occasion that , in regard to the whole number confined in that same
116_636_002_02_29 Hulk , he learnt what is mentioned by Sir Henry Mildmay & Mr Neild : ( a )
116_636_002_02_30 out of 500 , living at the commencement of the year 1801 , deaths 120 ,
116_636_002_02_31 at the end of it .
116_636_002_02_32 The survivors , upon his enquiry , say they are " half
116_636_002_02_33 " starved " : _ appearances speak the same thing : _ officers plump & rosy .
116_636_002_02_34 Would this be the case , if mere pestilence without famine were the
116_636_002_02_35 cause ? _ The question is not mine : to the humane and intelligent
116_636_002_02_36 informer belongs the credit of it . _

115_082_003_02_02 also agreed that the said first intended Governor and

115_082_003_02_09 -lic on behalf of the Prisoners is interested therein :
115_082_003_02_10 and moreover that they shall also by such Deputy or
115_082_003_02_11 if thereto ordered or required by the Court in person ,
115_082_003_02_12 then and there , as well as on any other day or days
115_082_003_02_13 on summons from the Court , or in Vacation time from
115_082_003_02_14 any Judge thereof full true and perfect answer make to
115_082_003_02_15 all such questions as shall be put to them in rela-
115_082_003_02_16 -tion thereto not only on the part of the Court or Officer

115_082_003_02_21 House , and dated the 22nd day of March 1784 it appears ,
115_082_003_02_22 that according to the first estimates made by Messrs :

115_082_003_02_27 amounted to the sum of £210,352 making for the

115_067_003_02_05 limitations and restrictions as are contained in an Act made
115_067_003_02_06 in the twentyfourth year of his present Majesty ' s reign , intituled
115_067_003_02_07 An Act for the effectual transportation of Felons and other Offen-
115_067_003_02_08 -ders and to authorise the removal of Prisoners in certain cases ,
115_067_003_02_09 and for other purposes therein mentioned , or under such other

115_067_003_02_11 under the powers of the said Act from time to time appoint
115_067_003_02_12 And Whereas in and by the said last mentioned Act power
115_067_003_02_13 is given to his Majesty to direct the removal of any male
115_067_003_02_14 offender under sentence of death but reprieved during pleasure
115_067_003_02_15 or under sentence of transportation and appearing in manner
115_067_003_02_16 therein mentioned fit so to be removed to such place of confine-
115_067_003_02_17 -ment within England and Wales as his Majesty shall ap-
115_067_003_02_18 -point under the management of any Overseer appointed by his
115_067_003_02_19 Majesty , whereupon it is therein moreover provided that every
115_067_003_02_20 offender so removed shall continue in the place of confinement ,
115_067_003_02_21 or be removed to and confined in any other place , as his Ma-

115_067_003_02_23 or by the expiration of his term shall be entitled to his liber-

115_067_003_02_25 to the Goal from which he shall have been removed ; And
115_067_003_02_26 Whereas it is therein also provided that after the removal of

115_065_004_02_01 That time the prices of divers articles necessary as materials
115_065_004_02_02 for the said intended Building as well as of divers articles
115_065_004_02_03 necessary for the maintenance of the said establishment , the
115_065_004_02_04 expence of which maintenance for the first year was included in
115_065_004_02_05 the said estimate of £27,000 , may by the circumstances of the
115_065_004_02_06 times be found to have undergone a considerable enhancement ,
115_065_004_02_07 in consequence whereof the effective power of the said proposed
115_065_004_02_08 partial allowance of £27,000 as well of the said Proposer ' s
115_065_004_02_09 private stock destined to have been added thereto is though
115_065_004_02_10 nominally the same , become in effect so much the less and
115_065_004_02_11 proportionally insufficient for the said intended purposes
115_065_004_02_12 And Whereas in particular the price of bricks hath within
115_065_004_02_13 the said period undergone an enhancement by means of a
115_065_004_02_14 duty thereon imposed by Parliament , to wit by an Act of the
115_065_004_02_15 28th of March 1794 Ch.15 , as also the price of glass by an
115_065_004_02_16 Act of the 1794 Ch . 37 _ And Whereas the
115_065_004_02_17 delay from whence such encrease of charge hath accrued hath
115_065_004_02_18 not happened through any default on the part of the said Pro-
115_065_004_02_19 -poser Now therefore it is hereby farther agreed that the said
115_065_004_02_20 Jeremy Bentham and his Representatives shall at any time
115_065_004_02_21 and so from time to time be at liberty to deliver in an account
115_065_004_02_22 of all or any such articles expended either in quality of
115_065_004_02_23 materials used in the construction of the said Building and
115_065_004_02_24 its appurtenances , or in quality of provisions or other necessa-
115_065_004_02_25 -ries for the prisoners actually consumed within the said year
115_065_004_02_26 together with the times at which they were respectively con-
115_065_004_02_27 -tracted for , accompanied with a comparative statement of
115_065_004_02_28 the prices at the two periods in question and the amount
115_065_004_02_29 of the enhancement upon each : such account to be accom-

073_054_001_02_01 THEFT .
073_054_001_03_01 Larceny , or that the Thing is under any intrinsic Incapacity
073_054_001_03_02 of becoming the Subject of an Act of that Nature , but only
073_054_001_03_03 that if it is stolen , as fairly stolen ( if it may be allowed
073_054_001_03_04 the Expression ) as any Thing whatever can be , [ still ] the
073_054_001_03_05 -so ever
073_054_001_03_06 Punishment for it is not of that Kind which , where
073_054_001_03_07 has by the Common Laws
073_054_001_03_08 it originally attached bestowed on the Act that
073_054_001_03_09 Denomination .
073_054_001_03_10 In a Word the Import of the Term Theft with
073_054_001_03_11 it ' s Conjugates above mentioned is coextensive with
073_054_001_03_12 the Moral Idea : Larceny with the Legal .
073_054_001_03_13 This Distinction is far from being steadily
073_054_001_03_14 observed : Writers every now & then stretching the
073_054_001_03_15 Import of the Word Larceny to a Synonimity with
073_054_001_03_16 hence it is that
073_054_001_03_17 Theft ; by which means Things are brought to that
073_054_001_03_18 pass , that now persons discoursing of a proposed Act
073_054_001_03_19 might say , the one that it was , the other that it was
073_054_001_03_20 not Larceny , both having the same Meaning . _ It is
073_054_001_03_21 in Order to avoid this Confusion that I give this Notice
073_054_001_03_22 ever
073_054_001_03_23 once for all , that if I use this technical Term in my
073_054_001_03_24 own person I use it not in Concurrence with , but in
073_054_001_03_25 Contradistinction to the other .
073_054_001_03_26 The
115_082_004_01_01 18
115_082_004_02_01 said hereby intended number of 1000 prisoners the sum
115_082_004_02_02 of £233,724,,8,,10 1/2 and according to the reduced estimate
115_082_004_02_03 afterwards made by the said Architects would for the
115_082_004_02_04 said number of 1000 have amounted to £183,652 : 4 : 5 1/4
115_082_004_02_05 exclusive of the expences of fitting up and stocking
115_082_004_02_06 the said establishment all which expences together
115_082_004_02_07 considering the usual and almost unavoidable dif-
115_082_004_02_08 -ference between estimated and actual expence could
115_082_004_02_09 not reasonably be reckoned at less than £215,000 in
115_082_004_02_10 the whole insomuch that the said Jeremy Bentham
115_082_004_02_11 whensoever he shall have fulfilled the present agree-
115_082_004_02_12 said including
115_082_004_02_13 -ment in relation to the intended establishment with
115_082_004_02_14 the fitting up and stocking of the same may reason-
115_082_004_02_15 to
115_082_004_02_16 -ably be computed to have save the public to the
115_082_004_02_17 the said
115_082_004_02_18 amount of at least £200,000 out of £215,000 in respect
115_082_004_02_19 at the least .
115_082_004_02_20 of the same And Whereas the sum of £15,000 being
115_082_004_02_21 all that will remain of the said allowed sum of
115_082_004_02_22 £27,000 after sitting apart the sum of £12,000 for the
115_082_004_02_23 maintenance of the said thousand Prisoners for one
115_082_004_02_24 year is not by any means a sufficient allowance for
115_082_004_02_25 the expence of building fitting up and stocking as a-
115_082_004_02_26 -foresaid but only a partial allowance towards the
115_082_004_02_27 same the bulk of the expenditure necessary for the
115_082_004_02_28 same being accordingly made up or to be made up by
115_082_004_02_29 and out of the private fortune or saved by the inge-
115_082_004_02_30 -nuity of the said Jeremy and the said Samuel Ben-
115_082_004_02_31 -tham or one of them And Whereas if such buildings
115_082_004_02_32 improvements and stock were not to be the property

116_631_001_02_02 " never fail of due attention , * that such relief would be
116_631_001_02_03 " obtained , as , without adding to the burthen of the County-
116_631_001_02_04 -rate , would enable the magistrates to carry the plan
116_631_001_02_05 " into effect " . _
116_631_001_02_06 No. . 3 . Page 44 . " What then may not reasonably be
116_631_001_02_07 " expected from one , who certainly feels , as much as any
116_631_001_02_08 " man , the importance of restraining vice , & improving

116_631_001_02_10 verily
116_631_001_02_11 " ( a ) This testimony , it is humbly hoped , will not be
116_631_001_02_12 " considered as an instance of flattery to the great
116_631_001_02_13 " person here alluded to , but a declaration , the truth
116_631_001_02_14 " of which , all to whom his character is known , will
116_631_001_02_15 " readily confirm " .
116_631_001_02_16 * What strange place can this be which the worthy
116_631_001_02_17 Magistrate is spaeaking of or dreaming of ? - I who have
116_631_001_02_18 been upon the look out for such a place for above these
116_631_001_02_19 8 years have never yet been able to meet with anything
116_631_001_02_20 like it ? Is it any where about the Treasury ? - any such
116_631_001_02_21 place as the closet of any such person as the " great
116_631_001_02_22 " person alluded to " presently after by the worthy Magis-
116_631_001_02_23 -trate ? Then as to foundation _ what sort of a ground
116_631_001_02_24 is it ( I wonder ) thant " an application " must have to
116_631_001_02_25 make it a " well founded " one ? - An Act of Parlia-
116_631_001_02_26 -ment for example ? applications have been made on
116_631_001_02_27 such grounds month after month , yeeaar after year , to

116_631_001_02_30 worse than none : _ it has had every property of refusal ,
116_631_001_02_31 saving only the honesty one the one part & the quietus on the other .

116_631_001_02_33 person great or otherwise , who by what he " feels " about " the
116_631_001_02_34 " importance of restraining vice and improving morals " is to

116_627_002_03_01 between floor and floor consulting with one another by
116_627_002_03_02 what words they should make Parliament believe that
116_627_002_03_03 I had insisted on an increase of terms , spite of all I
116_627_002_03_04 could say to the contrary reiterating to one another the
116_627_002_03_05 reciprocal assurances of that persevering fondness for
116_627_002_03_06 " improved prisons " as well as " improved Colonies " the
116_627_002_03_07 expression of which was so unexpectedly brought to light
116_627_002_03_08 Your Lordship and his Grace knows how.-
116_627_002_03_09 In the Panopticon system Your Lordship has been
116_627_002_03_10 seeing a plan , which because sanctioned and again
116_627_002_03_11 by Parliament , prescribed by an Act , confirmed four years
116_627_002_03_12 after in another Act , confirmed by £36.000 granted towards
116_627_002_03_13 the execution of it , and by £24.000 public money actu-
116_627_002_03_14 -ally expended in it , and if his Grace ' s will be done
116_627_002_03_15 wasted upon it , was termed a " project " , and under
116_627_002_03_16 that name of unfounded reprobation marked out for
116_627_002_03_17 " relinquishment " . Would to God his Grace ' s more success-
116_627_002_03_18 -ful plan - for emaciating his Majesty ' s subjects in by
116_627_002_03_19 a " long confinement " in illegally and purposely crowded
116_627_002_03_20 Jails , for producing Jail-Fevers in them or whatever
116_627_002_03_21 other miseries might be the result of their being " crowded "
116_627_002_03_22 each of them in the degree necessary to prevent it from
116_627_002_03_23 being " neglected " - for exercising over his fellow subjects
116_627_002_03_24 by the secret will of this servant of the Crown out of
116_627_002_03_25 sight of his royal master , that authority which , if
116_627_002_03_26 attempted to be exercised by the master , a Hampden
116_627_002_03_27 would have resisted with his blood - would to God
116_627_002_03_28 a plan like this , my Lord had been but a project !
116_627_002_03_29 Would to God that any considerations whatever , divine
116_627_002_03_30 or human , religious or moral , of police or economy , of
116_627_002_03_31 justice
096_100_003_01_01 much inferior will be produced hereafter to this sup-
096_100_003_01_02 -posed one , will be produced hereafter .
096_100_003_01_03 If from one third the Fine were to be in-
096_100_003_01_04 -creased to two thirds , the Law instead of being better
096_100_003_01_05 would now be just as bad again as it was before _
096_100_003_01_06 it is still as true as ever , that after the punishment
096_100_003_01_07 suffer ' dand over , it is always worth a Man ' s while
096_100_003_01_08 to commit the Crime whenever he has the Opportunity :
096_100_003_01_09 and the Misery of the Criminal is doubled .
096_100_003_01_10 Universally therefore the Inexpediency of the
096_100_003_01_11 Law is inversely as the Magnitude of the Punish-
096_100_003_01_12 -ment , up to the very Point at which that punish-
096_100_003_01_13 -ment has risen to an Equality with the Profit of
096_100_003_01_14 the Crime . "
096_100_003_01_15 7 . Where the Act prohibited is such as would pro-
096_100_003_01_16 -duce Unhappiness in the Community , and less
096_100_003_01_17 than the Penalty actually annexed to it _ ; but not
096_100_003_01_18 less than one might be substituted in it ' s
096_100_003_01_19 Room .
096_100_003_01_20 Such I conceive to be the Laws inflicting capi-
096_100_003_01_21 -tal Punishments on Thefts .
096_100_003_01_22 Here the Law simply & absolutely

072_094_003_04_01 Theft . Why Theft , Embezzlement , and ordinary Sharping
072_094_003_04_02 are all on the any same footing .
072_094_003_04_03 When property to acquire value is dishonestly usurped
072_094_003_04_04 it matters not whether it be by Theft or embezzlement
072_094_003_04_05 or Fraudulent obtainment certain cases only excepted when
072_094_003_04_06 fraud is punished with particular severity and measures
072_094_003_04_07 These are Forgery coining and dealing with false
072_094_003_04_08 weights
072_094_003_04_09 It will in many instances be impossible to distingu=
072_094_003_04_10 =ish whether it be a case of theft or of Embezzlement
072_094_003_04_11 and even when the distinction is made no reason can
072_094_003_04_12 be assigned why the punishment in the one case
072_094_003_04_13 should be different
072_094_003_04_14 from what it is in the other . Taking is beginning
072_094_003_04_15 to occupy : keeping is continuing to occupy or con=
072_094_003_04_16 Using
072_094_003_04_17 =tinuing in the intention of occupying . Securing is the
072_094_003_04_18 producing some contact between the body occupied and
072_094_003_04_19 some other body . here we are arrived at sensible ideas
072_094_003_04_20 ideas excited by assignable real entities that is at
072_094_003_04_21 the point at which all definitions must have an end

115_007_001_02_01 Proposal
115_007_001_02_02 For a new and less expensive mode
115_007_001_02_03 of
115_007_001_02_04 employing & reforming Convicts
115_007_001_02_05 The author , having turned his thoughts to the
115_007_001_02_06 Penitentiary system from its first origin , and having
115_007_001_02_07 lately contrived a building in which any number of
115_007_001_02_08 persons may be kept within the reach of being
115_007_001_02_09 inspected during every moment of their lives ,
115_007_001_02_10 and having made out as he flatters himself to
115_007_001_02_11 demonstration , that the only eligible mode of
115_007_001_02_12 managing an establishment of such a nature ,
115_007_001_02_13 in a building of such a construction would be by
115_007_001_02_14 contract , has been induced to make public the
115_007_001_02_15 following proposal for maintaining & employ-
115_007_001_02_16 -ing Convicts in general , or such of them as
115_007_001_02_17 would otherwise be confined on board the Hulks ,
115_007_001_02_18 for 25 per Cent less than it costs Government to
115_007_001_02_19 maintain them there at present ; deducting also
115_007_001_02_20 the average value of the work at present perform
115_007_001_02_21 -ed by them for Government : upon the terms of
115_007_001_02_22 his receiving the produce of their labour , taking
115_007_001_02_23 upon himself the whole expence of building , with
115_007_001_02_24 -out and advance to be made by Government for
115_007_001_02_25 that purpose , requiring only that the abatement
115_007_001_02_26 and deduction abovementioned shall be suspended for
115_007_001_02_27 the first year .
115_007_001_02_28 Upon
115_108_003_01_01 upon the premises , notwithstanding that
115_108_003_01_02 15
115_108_003_01_03 Government supply a large Sum , viz , £13 ,000
115_108_003_01_04 towards such Building on the Commencement
115_108_003_01_05 of the undertaking , and eventually a much
115_108_003_01_06 larger Sum , by paying him £18 for every
115_108_003_01_07 person committed to his Care , above the
115_108_003_01_08 Stipulated number of 1000 , for the express
115_108_003_01_09 purpose of providing an Habitation and
115_108_003_01_10 enlarging his premises . This appears much
115_108_003_01_11 too hard upon Government , & it would be
115_108_003_01_12 fairer to let that matter be referred , when
115_108_003_01_13 the period arrives , to two Arbitrators , one to
115_108_003_01_14 be chosen by government , the other by
115_108_003_01_15 Mr . B ' s . representatives , with power for them
115_108_003_01_16 to choose an Umpire in case of a Variance
115_108_003_01_17 in Opinion . Such Arbitrators to settle what
115_108_003_01_18 deduction ought to be made on behalf of
115_108_003_01_19 Government out of the Value of the
115_108_003_01_20 Premises &c . in Consideration of the said
115_108_003_01_21 15000
115_108_003_01_22 Sum of £30,000 , and the Amount of the
115_108_003_01_23 agregate Sum the said Payments of £18 _
115_108_003_01_24 may be estimated at .

115_010_002_02_01 Such are the methods that have occurred to
115_010_002_02_02 him for the accomplishing that identification of
115_010_002_02_03 interest with duty , the effectuating of which in the
115_010_002_02_04 person of the Governor , is declared to be one of the
115_010_002_02_05 leading objects of the Penitentiary Act .
115_010_002_02_06 The station of Jailor is not in common account
115_010_002_02_07 a very elevated one : the addition of Contractor has
115_010_002_02_08 not much tendency to raise it . He little dreamt ,
115_010_002_02_09 when he first launched into the subject , that he was
115_010_002_02_10 to become a suitor , and perhaps in vain , for such
115_010_002_02_11 an office . But inventions unpractised might be in
115_010_002_02_12 want of the inventory : and a situation , this clip-
115_010_002_02_13 -ped of emoluments while it was loaded with obliga-
115_010_002_02_14 -tions , might be in want of candidates . Penetrated
115_010_002_02_15 therefore with the importance of the end , he would
115_010_002_02_16 not suffer himself to see any thing unpleasant or
115_010_002_02_17 discreditable in the means .

072_071_004_04_03 the
072_071_004_04_04 time of summons is presented to him will either be the
072_071_004_04_05 same jurisdiction by which the something in question is
072_071_004_04_06 to be done to his person , or a different one .
072_071_004_04_07 in
072_071_004_04_08 If a different one , the place a man happens to be at the
072_071_004_04_09 time he receives the Summons may either be within the
072_071_004_04_10 reach or jurisdiction as it is called , of the authority from
072_071_004_04_11 which the summons is issued , or without it . If either , he
072_071_004_04_12 may either be about to go out of that jurisdiction , or not .
072_071_004_04_13 If not , a summons to come ( meaning from whatever place
072_071_004_04_14 he happens to be in to the place where he is to have justice
072_071_004_04_15 done upon him ) may be sufficient . Such a summons may
072_071_004_04_16 be stiled a and Justiciabilis venias . If he is about to go out
072_071_004_04_17 of the jurisdiction , a summons to stay , meaning within
072_071_004_04_18 that jurisdiction , may be necessary in order to compel his
072_071_004_04_19 being in the way to receive afterwards a Summons to come ;

115_011_002_02_31 in this point of view worth mentioning : it
115_011_002_02_32 would be for his own advantage to give them
115_011_002_02_33 every instruction by which the value of their

071_181_001_03_01 Of Frauds relative to the Coin .
071_181_001_04_01 only Coin which a man is obliged to accept in payment : unless
071_181_001_04_02 it be such foreign Coin as the State has thought proper to adopt :
071_181_001_04_03 which puts it upon the footing of domestic . On this account it may
071_181_001_04_04 be thought that the counterfeiting of the former is more mischie=
071_181_001_04_05 : vous than the counterfeiting of the latter . But this objection ,
071_181_001_04_06 when examined , will be found to be of little force . A piece
071_181_001_04_07 of domestic Coin , if it happens to be counterfeit , he is no more
071_181_001_04_08 obliged to take , than he is to take counterfeit foreign Coin .
071_181_001_04_09 When a piece of counterfeit domestic Coin then is tendered to him ,
071_181_001_04_10 if he suspects it , measures are taken , I suppose , by the Laws of
071_181_001_04_11 all Countries , to give him a right to put it to the test at his
071_181_001_04_12 peril ; so that if it turns out not to be good , the loss falls not
071_181_001_04_13 upon him but upon the tenderer . This obligation to accept is a
071_181_001_04_14 circumstance that applies not in one case out of ten thousand .
071_181_001_04_15 In ordinary Cases where a man accepts money , it is not that
071_181_001_04_16 he is forced but that he chuses so to do . The question then upon
071_181_001_04_17 which the mischief turns is whether there be any case in
071_181_001_04_18 which a man would have an adequate inducement to accept
071_181_001_04_19 of the counterfeit foreign Coin , if he did not suspect it so to be .

115_010_001_02_07 leave of the Court , on the part of any person what-
115_010_001_02_08 -soever : questions the answer to which might tend to
115_010_001_02_09 subject him to conviction though it were for a capital
115_010_001_02_10 crime , not excepted : treading underfoot a maxim
115_010_001_02_11 invented by the guilty for the benefit of the guilty ,
115_010_001_02_12 and from which none but the guilty ever derived any
115_010_001_02_13 advantage .
115_010_001_02_14 16.th By neatness and cleanliness , by diversity of em-
115_010_001_02_15 - ployment , by variety of contrivance , and above all ,
115_010_001_02_16 by that peculiarity of construction , which without any
115_010_001_02_17 unpleasant or hazardous vicinity enables the whole
115_010_001_02_18 establishment to be inspected at a view , from a
115_010_001_02_19 commodious and insulated room in the center , the
115_010_001_02_20 prisoners remaining unconscious of their being
115_010_001_02_21 thus observed , it should be his study to render it
115_010_001_02_22 a spectacle such as persons of all classes would
115_010_001_02_23 in the way of amusement be curious to partake
115_010_001_02_24 of : and that , not only on Sundays at the time of
115_010_001_02_25 Divine Service , but on ordinary days at meal times
115_010_001_02_26 or times of work : providing thereby a system of su-
115_010_001_02_27 -perintendence , universal , unchargeable , and un-
115_010_001_02_28 -interrupted , the most effectual and indestructible
115_010_001_02_29 of all securities against abuse .

116_287_002_02_01 " away from the Colony was now " ( says he ) " a matter of some
116_287_002_02_02 " difficulty , as it was understood that a clause was to be
116_287_002_02_03 " inserted in all future Contracts for shipping for the Colony ,
116_287_002_02_04 " subjecting the masters to certain penalties , on certificates being
116_287_002_02_05 " received of their having brought away any Convicts or other
116_287_002_02_06 " persons from this settlement without the Governor ' s permission ;
116_287_002_02_07 " and as it was not probable that many of them would , on
116_287_002_02_08 " their return , refrain from the vices or avoid the society of
116_287_002_02_09 " those companions who had been the causes of their transporta-
116_287_002_02_10 - " tion to this Country , not many could hope to obtain the
116_287_002_02_11 " sanction of the Governor for their return . "
116_287_002_02_12 " It was understood " : viz : by the author , Captain Collins ,
116_287_002_02_13 the Judge Advocate : most probably from the tenor of the instructions
116_287_002_02_14 sent , from the office now Your Lordship ' s , to the Governor ; at any
116_287_002_02_15 rate from the conversation of the Governor , the Governor speaking
116_287_002_02_16 from those instructions .
116_287_002_02_17 In this most instructive paragraph , Your Lordship
116_287_002_02_18 sees at once , the monstrous , yet in that quarter but too frequent ,
116_287_002_02_19 and natural , combination _ the combination of gross negligence
116_287_002_02_20 with gross oppression and injustice : in the first place the neg-
116_287_002_02_21 -ligence , and then , to make up for it , the injustice . For four
116_287_002_02_22 or five years _ for the time that none of the Convicts could
116_287_002_02_23 return without break of the law _ the door is left wide open
116_287_002_02_24 for their return : as soon as their right of returning takes
116_287_002_02_25 place , then it is that the door is shut against all alike _
116_287_002_02_26 right or no right _ by the undistinguishing hand of blind
116_287_002_02_27 and lawless tyranny . _
116_287_002_02_28 Till now , the mask had been kept on _ the hand of oppression
116_287_002_02_29 had worked unseen _ the force of nature _ the preventive powers

071_166_001_04_04 Provisions for Settling Disputes .
071_166_001_04_05 There remains nothing now but to make provision
071_166_001_04_06 for settling the disputes that are apt to arise concerning the weight
071_166_001_04_07 and legitimacy of money , where the money itself is suspected ,
071_166_001_04_08 but either no suspicion at all is entertained of the person who
071_166_001_04_09 tendered it , or none that is sufficient to warrant the employ=
071_166_001_04_10 : ing adverses measures for bringing him to Justice . Provisions
071_166_001_04_11 relatives to this head do not indeed strictly speaking belong to
071_166_001_04_12 the criminal branch ; but as they are intimately connected with
071_166_001_04_13 a subject that belongs properly to that branch , and may be
071_166_001_04_14 dispatched in a small compass , it may not be amiss to insert
071_166_001_04_15 them here . The tenor of these Provisions may be as follows :

073_073_001_03_03 of which by their frequent Use of it , Lawyers
073_073_001_03_04 seem to make no small account _ animus
073_073_001_03_05 furandi is the Will , Design , Intention , call it
073_073_001_03_06 which you please , to steal : stealing therefore
073_073_001_03_07 we learn is taking with the will to steal ; alias
073_073_001_03_08 stealing is wilful stealing : and what is
073_073_001_03_09 wilful stealing ? why it is wilful stealing #
073_073_001_03_10 2.dly The word " taking " we are told implies
073_073_001_03_11 the Consent of the owner to be wanting . ||
073_073_001_03_12 It is not true that the word " taking "
073_073_001_03_13 implies any such Thing . The ordinary
073_073_001_03_14 Conceptions concerning the Offence of Men
073_073_001_03_15 untutored by vitious Definitions imply as much :
073_073_001_03_16 but the word " taking " implies nothing about the
073_073_001_03_17 matter .
073_073_001_03_18 3.dly We are further told " there must not only
073_073_001_03_19 be a taking but a carrying away " , # acts it
073_073_001_03_20 should seem therefore mighty easily distinguishable
073_073_001_03_21 _ how easily , we have seen above .

116_078_001_02_02 " in want of many necessary articles of life ; and when there were
116_078_001_02_03 " brought by speculators and traders who occasionally touched there ,
116_078_001_02_04 " they demanded more than five hundred per cent above what the
116_078_001_02_05 " same articles could have been sent out for from England , with
116_078_001_02_06 " every addition of freight , insurance , &c . They saw the wants of
116_078_001_02_07 " the colony and availed themselves of its necessities . " _
116_078_001_02_08 6 . P.275 December 1799 . " At length the commissary was enabled
116_078_001_02_09 " to issue some slop cloathing to the convicts , a quantity having
116_078_001_02_10 " been received by the Walker ; but , unfortunately , much of what had
116_078_001_02_11 " been put on board arrived in a very damaged state , as appear ' d
116_078_001_02_12 " by a survey which was immediately taken . "
116_078_001_02_13 7 . P.285 . February 1800 _ " Some clothing had been received by these
116_078_001_02_14 " ships and the Walker , but , unfortunately , not any bedding . The
116_078_001_02_15 " governor therefore purchased a thousand bad rugs , which had
116_078_001_02_16 " been manufactured in some of the Spanish settlements on
116_078_001_02_17 " the west ocean coast of America , and where in the prize
116_078_001_02_18 " which last arrived . These , with a compleat suit of the clothing
116_078_001_02_19 " to each , were now issued to the convicts . " _

116_078_001_02_21 " nearly ruined by the high price they were obliged to give for such
116_078_001_02_22 " necessaries as they required from those who had been long in the
116_078_001_02_23 " habit of monopolising every article brought to the settlement for
116_078_001_02_24 " sale ; a habit of which it was found impossible to get the better ,
116_078_001_02_25 " without the positive and immediate interference of the government
116_078_001_02_26 " at home . " _
116_078_001_02_27 " Many representations had been made on this distressing
116_078_001_02_28 " subject ; and they seemed in some degree to have been attended to ,
116_078_001_02_29 " as in several of the last arrivals from England , certain articles ,
116_078_001_02_30 " consisting of implements of husbandry , cloathing , and stores , had
116_078_001_02_31 " been consigned to the governor , to be retailed for the use of the
116_078_001_02_32 " colonists ; and it was understood that this system , so beneficial
116_078_001_02_33 " to the settlement , was to be pursued in all the ships which
116_078_001_02_34 " were in future to carry out convicts or stores to that country . "

096_028_001_01_02 From this review then it appears, that
096_028_001_01_03 in paving the way to the consideration of
096_028_001_01_04 municipal Law, our Author has spent
096_028_001_01_05 supposed
096_028_001_01_06 much time in explaining the nature &
096_028_001_01_07 Properties of Laws which do not exist &
096_028_001_01_08 in misapplying those which do: & therefore,
096_028_001_01_09 that the best thing which a Student of the
096_028_001_01_10 Law can do is to forget all that our Author
096_028_001_01_11 has hitherto advanced.

097_186_001_01_01 Note ( ) to p.
097_186_001_01_02 Sydney New South Wales 20th May 1799
097_186_001_01_03 The fatigue to which the Governor of this territory must
097_186_001_01_04 submitt, both mental and corporeal, is far beyond any idea
097_186_001_01_05 you can have of the nature of his duty rendering such fatigue
097_186_001_01_06 necessary in the Commander in Chief.
097_186_001_01_07 My former knowledge and acquaintance with this Country
097_186_001_01_08 encouraged me in a hope, which however has in some respects
097_186_001_01_09 proved delusive: that I should with ease to myself and with
097_186_001_01_10 proper effect and advantage to the public, have been able to
097_186_001_01_11 not
097_186_001_01_12 manage all the duties of my office - But I had been long
097_186_001_01_13 entered upon it, before I was awakened from that dream of
097_186_001_01_14 comfort and satisfaction, the prospect of which I had so vainly
097_186_001_01_15 indulged! The seeds of the vexations which had so disappointed
097_186_001_01_16 me, had been sown for a very considerable time; and, being of
097_186_001_01_17 rather a prolific nature amongst such people, had gained so
097_186_001_01_18 much strength. that it will require immense labour to grab them
097_186_001_01_19 up by the root. I have persisted in my attempt to that end, and
097_186_001_01_20 mean not to change my system; which, be assured, from being cal-
097_186_001_01_21 -culated to lay restraints upon every species of vice and immorality,
097_186_001_01_22 cannot, amongst such character be a very popular one; that however
097_186_001_01_23 will be a matter of no immediate concern to me; if I succeed only
097_186_001_01_24 in a small degree, to check the growing profligacy and abandoned
097_186_001_01_25 turn of the lower classes of the people.
097_186_001_01_26 This is a good Country, and will do well: but its progress
097_186_001_01_27 in improvement would be considerable hastened, could Government
097_186_001_01_28 be prevailed upon not to overstock us with the worst description
097_186_001_01_29 of characters: for, whilst the mass of the people continue to be of
097_186_001_01_30 that class, our difficulties will ever be very considerable: the
097_186_001_01_31 industrious and well disposed become a continual prey to the
097_186_001_01_32 idle and worthless.
096_038_003_01_01 person, or body of men who are invested with
096_038_003_01_02 the power of making laws: for that Sovereignty
096_038_003_01_03 & legislature
096_038_003_01_04 are convertible terms. So that, our definition
096_038_003_01_05 receives little light from the addition of these
096_038_003_01_06 words: it amounting only to this, that law
096_038_003_01_07 is a rule of action prescribed by him, who
096_038_003_01_08 prescribes it.
096_038_003_01_09 ["It is also, says our Author, a rule, command-
096_038_003_01_10 "ing what is right, and forbidding what is
096_038_003_01_11 wrong." [If You ask our author, what he means
096_038_003_01_12 by w right, and wrong, he will tell You, that
096_038_003_01_13 is right which the law declares to be right,
096_038_003_01_14 and that is wrong which the law pronounces
096_038_003_01_15 to be wrong. So that, here again no new light
096_038_003_01_16 is

071_163_004_04_01 entirely cut off.
071_163_004_04_02 On this account it comes to be the more material to
071_163_004_04_03 search out by a circumstantial description the several pre=
071_163_004_04_04 operations
071_163_004_04_05 =liminary Acts which a man has occasion to perform, and
071_163_004_04_06 the several preliminary situations it is necessary for him
071_163_004_04_07 to put himself into, before he can be in a condition to
071_163_004_04_08 operations
071_163_004_04_09 perform the act intrinsically obnoxious. Of these acts
071_163_004_04_10 and situations there may be many which may present
071_163_004_04_11 a greater surface; as it were, to observation ( and from
071_163_004_04_12 thence to testimony) than the act itself of Coining: and
071_163_004_04_13 this even when taken separately; much more when they
071_163_004_04_14 come to be added altogether. The more ample then and
071_163_004_04_15 circumstantial the catalogue is that can be given of these
071_163_004_04_16 preliminary offences, the better chance there is of effecting
071_163_004_04_17 the purpose of preventing the principal one to which they
071_163_004_04_18 are introductory.
071_163_004_04_19 The following string of provisions are calculated in
071_163_004_04_20 some degree to answer that design. They are taken with
071_163_004_04_21 some

071_108_002_03_01 Of Matrimonial Desertion.
071_108_002_04_01 It will be necessary to define what shall be deemed
071_108_002_04_02 Desertion, distinguishing it from the case of lawful Absence;
071_108_002_04_03 and what steps shall be taken for giving notice.
071_108_002_04_04 Let certain methods be established whereby the Husband
071_108_002_04_05 and the Wife may be enabled and obliged to correspond with
071_108_002_04_06 one another at stated intervals: and let a failure on either part
071_108_002_04_07 for a certain time be deemed presumptive evidence of death or
071_108_002_04_08 this
071_108_002_04_09 desertion. Within the dominions of the state they might be manag=
071_108_002_04_10 =ed in the manner mentioned in the Book of Procedure. Tit.
071_108_002_04_11 As to foreigners, upon their coming into the country
071_108_002_04_12 let them be obliged to declare upon oath whether they are married
071_108_002_04_13 or single; and if single whether Bachelors or Spinsters, Widowers
071_108_002_04_14 or Widows. Of these declarations let Registers be kept, of which,
071_108_002_04_15 previous to their being married, copies should be required to be
071_108_002_04_16 produced. If married, certificates of the death of the Wife or
071_108_002_04_17 Husband. At present these important enquiries are left to the
071_108_002_04_18 uncertain prudence of individuals. The declarations above men=
071_108_002_04_19 :tioned should be accompanied with some details respecting their
071_108_002_04_20 birth, parentage and last abode; such as may lead to detection
071_108_002_04_21 in
115_007_002_01_01 2
115_007_002_01_02 upon the abovementioned terms he would engage
115_007_002_01_03 as follows_
115_007_002_01_04 1st. To furnish the prisoners with a constant supply
115_007_002_01_05 of wholesome food, not limited in quantity, but ade-
115_007_002_01_06 -quate to each man's desires.
115_007_002_01_07 2nd. To keep them clad in state of lightness and
115_007_002_01_08 neatness, superior to what is usual among the lower
115_007_002_01_09 classes or even in the improved prisons.
115_007_002_01_10 3rd. To keep them supplyed with separate beds and
115_007_002_01_11 bedding, competent to their situation, and in a state of
115_007_002_01_12 cleanliness scarce any where conjoined with liberty.
115_007_002_01_13 4th. To insure to them a sufficient supply of artificial
115_007_002_01_14 warmth and light, whenever the season renders it ne-
115_007_002_01_15 -cessary, and thereby preserve them from being obli-
115_007_002_01_16 -ged as in other places, to desist from their work, as
115_007_002_01_17 well as from suffering from the inclemency of the
115_007_002_01_18 weather.
115_007_002_01_19 5th. To keep constantly from them, in conformity to

072_069_002_04_03 any of them have failed, in that case Justice cannot

072_069_002_05_01 Note
072_069_002_05_02 begins earlier. The business of a civil Judge extends to the in=
072_069_002_05_03 forming of those who have occasion to be informed whether
072_069_002_05_04 were they to perform such or such acts in future such acts
072_069_002_05_05 would be offences: A man may commit an offence in
072_069_002_05_06 either of two ways, by usurping advantages that do not
072_069_002_05_07 belong to him; or by declining burthens that do belong to
072_069_002_05_08 him.
072_069_002_05_09 There are two ways in which a man may be said
072_069_002_05_10 to [apply] for such information: an active way and a passive: by

116_064_001_02_01 which so alarmed and terrified them, that they instantly fled,
116_064_001_02_02 leaving behind them their spears, &c. and about 20 bushels of
116_064_001_02_03 Indian-corn which they had stolen.
116_064_001_02_04 "It was distressing to observe that every endeavour to
116_064_001_02_05 "civilize these people proved fruitless. Although they lived among
116_064_001_02_06 "the inhabitants of the different settlements, were kindly treated,
116_064_001_02_07 "fed, and often cloathed, yet they were never found to profess the
116_064_001_02_08 "smallest degree of gratitude for such favours. Even Even Ben-nil-long
116_064_001_02_09 "was as destitute of this quality as the most ignorant of his coun-
116_064_001_02_10 -"trymen. "It is an extraordinary fact, that even their children, who
116_064_001_02_11 "had been bred among the white people, and who, from being
116_064_001_02_12 "accustomed to follow their manner of living, might have been
116_064_001_02_13 "supposed to ill relish the life of their parents, when grown up,
116_064_001_02_14 "have quitted their comfortable abodes, females as well as males,
116_064_001_02_15 "and taken to the same savage mode of living, where the sup-
116_064_001_02_16 -"ply "of food was often precarious, their comforts not to be called
116_064_001_02_17 "such, and their lives perpetually in danger. As a proof of the little
116_064_001_02_18 "personal safety which they enjoyed, a young young woman, the
116_064_001_02_19 "wife of a man named Ye-ra-ni-be , both of whom had been
116_064_001_02_20 "brought up in the settlement from their childhood, was cruelly
116_064_001_02_21 "murdered at the brickfields by her husband, assisted by another
116_064_001_02_22 "native, Cole-be , who first beat her dreadfully about the head (the
116_064_001_02_23 "common mode of chastising their women), and then put an end to
116_064_001_02_24 "her existence by driving a spear through her heart.
116_064_001_02_25 "When spoken to or censured for robbing the maize grounds,
116_064_001_02_26 "these people, to be revenged, were accustomed to assemble in large
116_064_001_02_27 "bodies, burn the homes of the settlers if they stood in lonely situa-
116_064_001_02_28 -"tions, "and frequently attempted to take their lives; yet they were
116_064_001_02_29 "seldom refused a live corn when they were asked for it. It was
116_064_001_02_30 "imagined that they were stimulated to this destructive conduct by
116_064_001_02_31 "some run-away convicts who were known to be among them at
116_064_001_02_32 "the time of their committing these depravations. In order to get
116_064_001_02_33 "possession of these pests, a proclamation was issued, calling on
116_064_001_02_34 "them by name to surrender themselves within 14 days, declaring
116_064_001_02_35 "them outlaws if they refused, and requiring the inhabitants, as
116_064_001_02_36 "they valued the peace and good order of the settlement, and their
116_064_001_02_37 "own security, to assist in apprehending and bringing them to
116_064_001_02_38 "justice. The governor also signified his determination, if any of the

071_021_002_04_04 regards the matter of fact or the matter of law. It regards
071_021_002_04_05 the matter of fact where you suppose some damage to
071_021_002_04_06 have been done you by your adversary, whereas in fact
071_021_002_04_07 he has done you no such damage. It regards the mat=
071_021_002_04_08 :ter of law, where you suppose him to have no right
071_021_002_04_09 to do you such damage, whereas in truth he had a

115_111_004_02_03 100 are received into this £100,000 House. What is
115_111_004_02_04 the consequence? that for each Convict House rent
115_111_004_02_05 alone (£5000 at 5 per Cent) comes to £50 a year.
115_111_004_02_06 On Mr Bentham's plan it comes to £9 a year, and
115_111_004_02_07 that for two years only.
115_111_004_02_08 A plain proof that all idea of refunding was
115_111_004_02_09 out of the question, or rather that it was perfectly
115_111_004_02_10 understood that nothing should be refunded, is, that
115_111_004_02_11 Mr Bentham was, for months together, with the
115_111_004_02_12 privit of Government and at the recommendation of
115_111_004_02_13 Government, in treaty on his own account with the
115_111_004_02_14 Proprietors for the purchase of the Land: Government
115_111_004_02_15 having agreed to advance the purchase money in that
115_111_004_02_16 case to Mr Bentham for a short time. The Pro-
115_111_004_02_17 -prietors not complying; an Act of Parliament for
115_111_004_02_18 this and other purposes was thought necessary: and
115_111_004_02_19 upon that occasion it was, that it was notified to
115_111_004_02_20 Mr Bentham, as the determination of Government,
115_111_004_02_21 that the Ground should be purchased, not on Mr
115_111_004_02_22 Bentham's account, but on the account of Government:
115_111_004_02_23 but that due satisfaction should be made to Mr
115_111_004_02_24 Bentham and his Representatives. No reason was
115_111_004_02_25 assigned for this departure: Mr Bentham's consent to it
115_111_004_02_26 was not called for: it was not given: he was not heard

072_050_003_03_01 Offences against the external Security of the State.
072_050_003_04_01 is commonly distinguished by the name Piracy.
072_050_003_04_02 When an Offence against Property originates in a
072_050_003_04_03 motive of rapacity and not in motives of resentment the
072_050_003_04_04 property of one person will answer the purpose as well
072_050_003_04_05 as another . If therefore the primary mischief of such an Of:
072_050_003_04_06 :fence be confined to a single state, the secondary mischief,
072_050_003_04_07 however, extends itself to all states the members of which
072_050_003_04_08 are likely to come in the offender's way. An act of Piracy is
072_050_003_04_09 therefore commonly looked upon as an act of hostility against
072_050_003_04_10 mankind in general . The least therefore which is expected
072_050_003_04_11 from the State of which the Pirate is a member is that
072_050_003_04_12 it should acquiesce in his being punished : If it happens
072_050_003_04_13 to have any particular means in its hands of punishing
072_050_003_04_14 him , it may also be expected to take an active part in pu=
072_050_003_04_15 :nishing him : as likewise in punishing any accomplices
072_050_003_04_16 he may have ; and in taking any other expedients that
072_050_003_04_17 may occur for preventing the offence . This holds good more
072_050_003_04_18 particularly with regard to accomplices ; because their
072_050_003_04_19 residence will frequently be upon land within the domi=
072_050_003_04_20 while
072_050_003_04_21 :nions of a particular state which his excursions are
072_050_003_04_22 carried on upon that element which is common to man=
072_050_003_04_23 =kind.

115_009_002_02_01 Upon the abovementioned terms he would engage
115_009_002_02_02 as follows_
115_009_002_02_03 1.st To furnish the prisoners with a constant supply
115_009_002_02_04 of wholesome food, not limited in quantity, but a-
115_009_002_02_05 -dequate to each man's desires.
115_009_002_02_06 2. To keep them clad in a state of lightness & neat-
115_009_002_02_07 -ness, superior to what is usual among the lower clas-
115_009_002_02_08 -ses or even in the improved prisons.
115_009_002_02_09 3rd To keep them supplied with separate beds and
115_009_002_02_10 bedding, competent to their situation, and in a state
115_009_002_02_11 of cleanliness scarce any where conjoined with liberty.
115_009_002_02_12 4th To insure to them a sufficient supply of artificial
115_009_002_02_13 warmth and light, whenever the season renders it
115_009_002_02_14 necessary, and thereby preserve them from being
115_009_002_02_15 obliged as in other places, to desist from their work,
115_009_002_02_16 as well as from suffering from the inclemency of
115_009_002_02_17 the weather.
115_009_002_02_18 5.th To keep constantly from them, in conformity to the
115_009_002_02_19 practice so happily received, every kind of strong &
115_009_002_02_20 spirituous liquor, unless where ordered in the way of
115_009_002_02_21 medicine.
115_009_002_02_22 6th To maintain them in a state of inviolable
115_009_002_02_23 though mitigated seclusion, in small assorted com-
115_009_002_02_24 panies, without any of those opportunities of pro
115_009_002_02_25 -miscuous association, which in other improved pri-
115_009_002_02_26 -sons disturb if not destroy whatever good effect can
115_009_002_02_27 have been expected from solitude.

073_068_001_03_10 the Medium of any of those specific Heads: the
073_068_001_03_11 Establishment of them as the Subjects of distinct
073_068_001_03_12 Questions to the Jury would therefore have no Use; and
073_068_001_03_13 it might have this Inconvenience, that the
073_068_001_03_14 be
073_068_001_03_15 Distinction between them would not in every Care
073_068_001_03_16 so clear, as that the Jury could concur in affirming
073_068_001_03_17 the Existence of any one in particular and disaffirming
073_068_001_03_18 that of the others: hence if the Interrogatories
073_068_001_03_19 concerning each were put separately, tho' some one
073_068_001_03_20 or other of these Circumstances unquestionably had
073_068_001_03_21 Existence, yet not knowing precisely which, they
073_068_001_03_22 would think themselves obliged to disaffirm it of

073_068_001_03_24 For
116_387_001_01_01 My Lords, Whitehall 14 Oct. 1799.
116_387_001_01_02 Mr King having laid before me a Letter from
116_387_001_01_03 Mr Long of the 27th ulto, desiring, by command of
116_387_001_01_04 your Lordships, to be apprized of the number of Con-
116_387_001_01_05 -victs, which the Panopticon proposed to be erected by
116_387_001_01_06 Mr Bentham, is intended to accommodate. I have
116_387_001_01_07 examined the Acts of the 19th & 34th of his present
116_387_001_01_08 Majesty, relative to the building of Penitentiary Houses
116_387_001_01_09 for confining and employing in hard labour, Persons
116_387_001_01_10 convicted of transportable and other Crimes.
116_387_001_01_11 I understand the object of these Acts to be, that
116_387_001_01_12 such Penitentiary Houses should be used principally
116_387_001_01_13 as receptacles for such transportable Convicts as the
116_387_001_01_14 several Gaols of the respective Counties cannot contain,
116_387_001_01_15 from the time of their receiving sentence, till an
116_387_001_01_16 opportunity may offer for their being transported.
116_387_001_01_17 With respect to the probably number of transport-
116_387_001_01_18 -able Convicts _
116_387_001_01_19 no safer rule can be adopted, than by taking the
116_387_001_01_20 greatest number of the four last years of Peace:
116_387_001_01_21 though it may increase, yet the increase of live
116_387_001_01_22 Stock use will probably more than counter balance the
116_387_001_01_23 difference.]
116_387_001_01_24 will probably more than counterbalance the difference.

116_072_001_02_02 "the rearing of swine in the colony, as well as of every other
116_072_001_02_03 "kind of live stock, a circumstance that must not only prove
116_072_001_02_04 "a great benefit to the public, but be also highly to the advantage
116_072_001_02_05 "of those who devoted a part of their time to this useful purpose,
116_072_001_02_06 "and which, from the advanced state of the private farmers, might
116_072_001_02_07 "now be done with far less trouble and expence than formerly, the
116_072_001_02_08 "settlers and others were informed, that when any individual should
116_072_001_02_09 "have prepared a number of such animals fit for the public
116_072_001_02_10 "store, they might make the same known to the commissary,
116_072_001_02_11 "who, in order to prevent any unnecessary expence to the feeder,
116_072_001_02_12 "would get give immediate notice of the day and place when
116_072_001_02_13 "and where he would receive them. He was also at liberty to

072_049_002_03_01 Offences against the external Security of the State.
072_049_002_04_01 naturally under the several titles which are taken from
072_049_002_04_02 the several different ways in which the party injured
072_049_002_04_03 either
072_049_002_04_04 may be affected by them. They are offences against person,
072_049_002_04_05 or or
072_049_002_04_06 offences against property, offences against reputation, and
072_049_002_04_07 so forth, as the case may be.
072_049_002_04_08 If the place in which the offence was committed be
072_049_002_04_09 within the dominions of a third state it is from such third
072_049_002_04_10 power that the state of which the party injured is a
072_049_002_04_11 member will expect satisfaction in the first instance. If
072_049_002_04_12 however it be out of its power to give satisfaction the
072_049_002_04_13 property as well as person of the offender being out of
072_049_002_04_14 its reach, the injured state may naturally enough be dis=
072_049_002_04_15 :posed to resort to that of which the offender is a mem=
072_049_002_04_16 :ber. It may perhaps expect the same punishment to
072_049_002_04_17 be inflicted on him as would be inflicted on him for
072_049_002_04_18 an offence of the same kind committed to the prejudice
072_049_002_04_19 of a fellow member; it will hardly expect more.
072_049_002_04_20 If the place be a vacant spot not within the domi=
072_049_002_04_21 :nions of any state, the state of which the offender is a mem=
072_049_002_04_22 :ber will naturally be that to which the injured state
072_049_002_04_23 will resort in the first instance. It may however resort

071_022_003_04_08 You with a stick at a time that a stout stick and an iron
071_022_003_04_09 bar of the same size were both lying within your reach:
071_022_003_04_10 where upon snatching up the iron bar you strike him in
071_022_003_04_11 such a manner as to give him dangerous bruise or kill
071_022_003_04_12 him. In such case unless it appears that you deliberately took
071_022_003_04_13 up the iron bar in preference to the stick intending there=

071_022_003_04_18 :much that it would have been doubtful whether with the less

035_327_001_02_10 on the part of the Immediate Judicatory, in which
035_327_001_02_11 case it may perhaps be deemed fit by the Le-

035_327_001_02_13 lay down as the general rule, that in these easy

071_181_004_04_05 an Article of so small a value as the Copper Coin should be
071_181_004_04_06 punished as severely as a fraud upon one of so high a value
071_181_004_04_07 as the Silver or even the Gold Coin, since the profit that
071_181_004_04_08 may be made by the falsifying any piece of the less precious
071_181_004_04_09 metal is not near so great as that which may be made
071_181_004_04_10 by the falsifying of the more precious metal. But the case
071_181_004_04_11 here is that the mischief is not to be estimated from the ef=
071_181_004_04_12 :fects of a single Act but from the effects of the Habit. Now
071_181_004_04_13 when the Habit is taken into the Account the one practice
071_181_004_04_14 does not seem to demand in any considerable degree a great=
071_181_004_04_15 :er punishment than the other. Where the profit upon a
071_181_004_04_16 single piece is the greatest, the difficulty of getting it off is
071_181_004_04_17 the greatest. The profit upon a base shilling may, it is
071_181_004_04_18 true be 24 times as great (or perhaps more) as the profit
071_181_004_04_19 upon

071_151_003_03_01 Defraudment by false standards
071_151_003_04_01 particular regulations can be of service will need to be different
071_151_003_04_02 according to the local circumstances of the different countries in
071_151_003_04_03 which the several articles happen to be in use. Mean while any
071_151_003_04_04 frauds that can be committed in relation to any of those articles
071_151_003_04_05 will not go unpunished: since they will all come under the general

071_151_003_04_07 Instructions to the Legislator
071_151_003_04_08 The notion of a false standard supposes the existence
071_151_003_04_09 of a genuine one. To establish these genuine ones for every pur:

071_201_003_04_03 A State Tumult is a Misdemeanour.
071_201_003_04_04 For damage sustained by parties injured in the
071_201_003_04_05 course of a tumult all offenders concerned in the same tumult
071_201_003_04_06 are liable, whether it can or cannot be proved that they act
071_201_003_04_07 in concert.
071_201_003_04_08 All illegal acts are to be deemed parts of the Same

071_201_003_04_10 more than [Ten] miles distance from each other in point

071_201_003_04_12 in point of time.
071_201_003_04_13 Reasons.
071_201_003_04_14 1. This makes it the interest of all persons concerned in the
071_201_003_04_15 same tumult to sit a watch upon each other, and do what
071_201_003_04_16 is in their power to moderate each others violence. By this
071_201_003_04_17 means it is subservient to the purpose of prevention.
071_201_003_04_18 2. It also gives a much better chance to parties injured
071_201_003_04_19 of obtaining compleat compensation than they would other=
071_201_003_04_20 :wise have: and making the damage fall upon the au=
071_201_003_04_21 :thors.
071_201_003_04_22 3. It facilitates the detection of offenders; by making it
071_201_003_04_23 the
116_633_002_01_01 44
116_633_002_02_01 few drops from it to save this worthy gentleman.
116_633_002_02_02 If it be in the power of virtue to give a claim to
116_633_002_02_03 mercy, has he not virtue to comm command it?
116_633_002_02_04 This faith, his hope, his charity, do they not all
116_633_002_02_05 center in great persons?
116_633_002_02_06 Speak to him then, my Lord, once more: _
116_633_002_02_07 say to him any thing that will make him easy.
116_633_002_02_08 Show him how right and wrong depend upon existing
116_633_002_02_09 circumstances: _ whisper to him that all this Ma-
116_633_002_02_10 -chiavelism for throwing prisoners upon Counties
116_633_002_02_11 was a mere make-believe: satisfy him that nothing
116_633_002_02_12 can be a matter of more profound indifference to
116_633_002_02_13 any body than it is to great persons in what Jal
116_633_002_02_14 Jail, or Hulk, or improved Colony, and in what numbers,
116_633_002_02_15 human creatures starve or poison one another, so that
116_633_002_02_16 there be not a "Panopticon for them to be sent to": _
116_633_002_02_17 remind him, that in the place he has in view, no
116_633_002_02_18 offence can, by any Jail or number of Jails, improved
116_633_002_02_19 or unimproved, be ever given to Noble Lords, whose
116_633_002_02_20 veto, when they are pleased to pronounce it, is so
116_633_002_02_21 fatal to Acts of Parliament: _ assure him, that neither
116_633_002_02_22 by the great person, nor by any other, is the purse
116_633_002_02_23 ever taken out of the hands of Parliament, unless for
116_633_002_02_24 a particular purpose, and to oblige a friend: certify

116_633_002_02_28 convenience of each moment presents them to great
116_633_002_02_29 minds: explain to him, that when persons are approved of,

073_083_001_02_01 Simple Personal Injuries
073_083_001_03_01 Where the quantity of damage which was intended is the
073_083_001_03_02 very quantity which eventually ensues, the act may be said
073_083_001_03_03 to be adequately intentional with respect to its conse-
073_083_001_03_04 -quences; when not so much, inadequately; when more,
073_083_001_03_05 more than adequately
073_083_001_03_06 You intended for instance to strike the porter,
073_083_001_03_07 whose leg you have broken. If
073_083_001_03_08 If your intention was to strike him in the leg in such
073_083_001_03_09 manner that he might be obliged to have it cut off, or if
073_083_001_03_10 you intended to strike him in the fore-arm in such manner
073_083_001_03_11 that he might be obliged to have his fore-arm cut off, and the
073_083_001_03_12 case is that the damage he would suffer from the loss of a
073_083_001_03_13 leg would not be materially greater or less than what he
073_083_001_03_14 would suffer from the loss of a fore-arm, in either of these
073_083_001_03_15 cases the act was adequately intentional with regard to
073_083_001_03_16 the quality of damage.
073_083_001_03_17 If your intention was only to hurt him in the fore-
073_083_001_03_18 arm or the leg without depriving him of either, the act
073_083_001_03_19 e
073_083_001_03_20 was inad quately intentional: if your intention was to
073_083_001_03_21 deprive him of his thigh or the whole of his arm the act
073_083_001_03_22 was-
116_286_002_01_01 2
116_286_002_02_01 The design was _ that Convicts once sent there should
116_286_002_02_02 never come back again. The plan, if there had been any
116_286_002_02_03 such thing, about the return of Convicts, would have been
116_286_002_02_04 dictated either by what I call justice (in which case it would
116_286_002_02_05 have run counter to the design) or by the supposed profitable
116_286_002_02_06 injustice. On the former supposition, arrangements would have been
116_286_002_02_07 taken in the first place, for preventing the emigration of each
116_286_002_02_08 Convict before the expiration of his legal terms of punishment_
116_286_002_02_09 in the next place, for affording him the means of quitting the
116_286_002_02_10 Country immediately after _ if such should be his choice: _ ar-
116_286_002_02_11 -rangements, if not of the positive cast, at any rate of the negative
116_286_002_02_12 viz: by removing from that time forwards whatever
116_286_002_02_13 obstacle might till then have been opposed as such to his escape.
116_286_002_02_14 Whatever had been the term of punishment fixed by each man's
116_286_002_02_15 sentence _ fourteen years _ between fourteen years and seven years _
116_286_002_02_16 seven years or any shorter term _ care would have been taken at
116_286_002_02_17 any rate, that from and after the expiration of it, his return
116_286_002_02_18 should not be opposed by any positive and_factitious obstacle, the
116_286_002_02_19 the effect of which would be to render it more difficult from this
116_286_002_02_20 new spot than it used to be from the old spots, to which this
116_286_002_02_21 new discovered one was now substituted. _
116_286_002_02_22 Not to oppose, or suffer to be opposed, any obstruction to the
116_286_002_02_23 return of a de jure emancipated Convict _ to take measures for
116_286_002_02_24 rendering it neither more nor less easy than under the old
116_286_002_02_25 system, or, if that could not be done, still easier _ one or other of
116_286_002_02_26 those distinguishable lines of conduct would (in my humble
116_286_002_02_27 conception) have been the line of justice: which of them (since
116_286_002_02_28 no one of them was pursued) is scarce worth arguing about.
116_286_002_02_29 There remains the line of supposed profitable injustice _
116_286_002_02_30 of
