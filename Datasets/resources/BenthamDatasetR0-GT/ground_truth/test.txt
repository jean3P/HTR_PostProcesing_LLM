test/096_028_001_01_02.png From this review then it appears, that
test/096_028_001_01_03.png in paving the way to the consideration of
test/096_028_001_01_04.png municipal Law, our Author has spent
test/096_028_001_01_05.png supposed
test/096_028_001_01_06.png much time in explaining the nature &
test/096_028_001_01_07.png Properties of Laws which do not exist &
test/096_028_001_01_08.png in misapplying those which do: & therefore,
test/096_028_001_01_09.png that the best thing which a Student of the
test/096_028_001_01_10.png Law can do is to forget all that our Author
test/096_028_001_01_11.png has hitherto advanced.

test/097_186_001_01_03.png The fatigue to which the Governor of this territory must
test/097_186_001_01_04.png submitt, both mental and corporeal, is far beyond any idea
test/097_186_001_01_05.png you can have of the nature of his duty rendering such fatigue
test/097_186_001_01_06.png necessary in the Commander in Chief.
test/097_186_001_01_07.png My former knowledge and acquaintance with this Country
test/097_186_001_01_08.png encouraged me in a hope, which however has in some respects
test/097_186_001_01_09.png proved delusive: that I should with ease to myself and with
test/097_186_001_01_10.png proper effect and advantage to the public, have been able to
test/097_186_001_01_11.png not
test/097_186_001_01_12.png manage all the duties of my office - But I had been long
test/097_186_001_01_13.png entered upon it, before I was awakened from that dream of
test/097_186_001_01_14.png comfort and satisfaction, the prospect of which I had so vainly
test/097_186_001_01_15.png indulged! The seeds of the vexations which had so disappointed
test/097_186_001_01_16.png me, had been sown for a very considerable time; and, being of
test/097_186_001_01_17.png rather a prolific nature amongst such people, had gained so
test/097_186_001_01_18.png much strength. that it will require immense labour to grab them
test/097_186_001_01_19.png up by the root. I have persisted in my attempt to that end, and
test/097_186_001_01_20.png mean not to change my system; which, be assured, from being cal-
test/097_186_001_01_21.png -culated to lay restraints upon every species of vice and immorality,
test/097_186_001_01_22.png cannot, amongst such character be a very popular one; that however
test/097_186_001_01_23.png will be a matter of no immediate concern to me; if I succeed only
test/097_186_001_01_24.png in a small degree, to check the growing profligacy and abandoned
test/097_186_001_01_25.png turn of the lower classes of the people.
test/097_186_001_01_26.png This is a good Country, and will do well: but its progress
test/097_186_001_01_27.png in improvement would be considerable hastened, could Government
test/097_186_001_01_28.png be prevailed upon not to overstock us with the worst description
test/097_186_001_01_29.png of characters: for, whilst the mass of the people continue to be of
test/097_186_001_01_30.png that class, our difficulties will ever be very considerable: the
test/097_186_001_01_31.png industrious and well disposed become a continual prey to the
test/097_186_001_01_32.png idle and worthless.
test/096_038_003_01_01.png person, or body of men who are invested with
test/096_038_003_01_02.png the power of making laws: for that Sovereignty
test/096_038_003_01_03.png & legislature
test/096_038_003_01_04.png are convertible terms. So that, our definition
test/096_038_003_01_05.png receives little light from the addition of these
test/096_038_003_01_06.png words: it amounting only to this, that law
test/096_038_003_01_07.png is a rule of action prescribed by him, who
test/096_038_003_01_08.png prescribes it.
test/096_038_003_01_09.png ["It is also, says our Author, a rule, command-
test/096_038_003_01_10.png "ing what is right, and forbidding what is

test/096_038_003_01_12.png by w right, and wrong, he will tell You, that
test/096_038_003_01_13.png is right which the law declares to be right,
test/096_038_003_01_14.png and that is wrong which the law pronounces

test/071_163_004_04_05.png =liminary Acts which a man has occasion to perform, and
test/071_163_004_04_06.png the several preliminary situations it is necessary for him
test/071_163_004_04_07.png to put himself into, before he can be in a condition to
test/071_163_004_04_08.png operations
test/071_163_004_04_09.png perform the act intrinsically obnoxious. Of these acts
test/071_163_004_04_10.png and situations there may be many which may present
test/071_163_004_04_11.png a greater surface; as it were, to observation ( and from
test/071_163_004_04_12.png thence to testimony) than the act itself of Coining: and
test/071_163_004_04_13.png this even when taken separately; much more when they
test/071_163_004_04_14.png come to be added altogether. The more ample then and
test/071_163_004_04_15.png circumstantial the catalogue is that can be given of these
test/071_163_004_04_16.png preliminary offences, the better chance there is of effecting
test/071_163_004_04_17.png the purpose of preventing the principal one to which they
test/071_163_004_04_18.png are introductory.
test/071_163_004_04_19.png The following string of provisions are calculated in
test/071_163_004_04_20.png some degree to answer that design. They are taken with

test/071_108_002_03_01.png Of Matrimonial Desertion.
test/071_108_002_04_01.png It will be necessary to define what shall be deemed
test/071_108_002_04_02.png Desertion, distinguishing it from the case of lawful Absence;
test/071_108_002_04_03.png and what steps shall be taken for giving notice.
test/071_108_002_04_04.png Let certain methods be established whereby the Husband
test/071_108_002_04_05.png and the Wife may be enabled and obliged to correspond with
test/071_108_002_04_06.png one another at stated intervals: and let a failure on either part
test/071_108_002_04_07.png for a certain time be deemed presumptive evidence of death or
test/071_108_002_04_08.png this
test/071_108_002_04_09.png desertion. Within the dominions of the state they might be manag=
test/071_108_002_04_10.png =ed in the manner mentioned in the Book of Procedure. Tit.
test/071_108_002_04_11.png As to foreigners, upon their coming into the country
test/071_108_002_04_12.png let them be obliged to declare upon oath whether they are married
test/071_108_002_04_13.png or single; and if single whether Bachelors or Spinsters, Widowers
test/071_108_002_04_14.png or Widows. Of these declarations let Registers be kept, of which,
test/071_108_002_04_15.png previous to their being married, copies should be required to be
test/071_108_002_04_16.png produced. If married, certificates of the death of the Wife or
test/071_108_002_04_17.png Husband. At present these important enquiries are left to the
test/071_108_002_04_18.png uncertain prudence of individuals. The declarations above men=
test/071_108_002_04_19.png :tioned should be accompanied with some details respecting their

test/115_007_002_01_02.png upon the abovementioned terms he would engage
test/115_007_002_01_03.png as follows_
test/115_007_002_01_04.png 1st. To furnish the prisoners with a constant supply
test/115_007_002_01_05.png of wholesome food, not limited in quantity, but ade-
test/115_007_002_01_06.png -quate to each man's desires.
test/115_007_002_01_07.png 2nd. To keep them clad in state of lightness and
test/115_007_002_01_08.png neatness, superior to what is usual among the lower
test/115_007_002_01_09.png classes or even in the improved prisons.
test/115_007_002_01_10.png 3rd. To keep them supplyed with separate beds and
test/115_007_002_01_11.png bedding, competent to their situation, and in a state of
test/115_007_002_01_12.png cleanliness scarce any where conjoined with liberty.
test/115_007_002_01_13.png 4th. To insure to them a sufficient supply of artificial
test/115_007_002_01_14.png warmth and light, whenever the season renders it ne-
test/115_007_002_01_15.png -cessary, and thereby preserve them from being obli-
test/115_007_002_01_16.png -ged as in other places, to desist from their work, as
test/115_007_002_01_17.png well as from suffering from the inclemency of the
test/115_007_002_01_18.png weather.
test/115_007_002_01_19.png 5th. To keep constantly from them, in conformity to
test/115_007_002_01_20.png the practice so happily received, every kind of strong
test/115_007_002_01_21.png and spirituous liquor, unless where ordered in the
test/115_007_002_01_22.png way of medicine.
test/115_007_002_01_23.png 6th. To maintain them in a state of inviolable though
test/115_007_002_01_24.png mitigated seclusion, in small assorted companies,
test/115_007_002_01_25.png without any of those opportunities of promiscuous
test/115_007_002_01_26.png association, which in other improved prisons disturb
test/115_007_002_01_27.png if not destroy whatever good effect can have been expected

test/072_069_002_04_01.png particulars have concurred, in that case Justice cannot
test/072_069_002_04_02.png but have been properly administered. In any case let
test/072_069_002_04_03.png any of them have failed, in that case Justice cannot
test/072_069_002_04_04.png have been properly administered. There cannot therefore

test/072_069_002_04_06.png be any other offered against Justice than what have
test/072_069_002_04_07.png one of the tendencies just mentioned. Not that this deter=

test/072_069_002_04_09.png the intervention of improvement from this branch of Le=

test/072_069_002_04_14.png the omission of it will become an accession to the List
test/072_069_002_04_15.png of such offences. As
test/072_069_002_05_01.png Note
test/072_069_002_05_02.png begins earlier. The business of a civil Judge extends to the in=

test/072_069_002_05_04.png were they to perform such or such acts in future such acts
test/072_069_002_05_05.png would be offences: A man may commit an offence in
test/072_069_002_05_06.png either of two ways, by usurping advantages that do not
test/072_069_002_05_07.png belong to him; or by declining burthens that do belong to
test/072_069_002_05_08.png him.
test/072_069_002_05_09.png There are two ways in which a man may be said

test/116_064_001_02_03.png Indian-corn which they had stolen.
test/116_064_001_02_04.png "It was distressing to observe that every endeavour to
test/116_064_001_02_05.png "civilize these people proved fruitless. Although they lived among
test/116_064_001_02_06.png "the inhabitants of the different settlements, were kindly treated,
test/116_064_001_02_07.png "fed, and often cloathed, yet they were never found to profess the
test/116_064_001_02_08.png "smallest degree of gratitude for such favours. Even Even Ben-nil-long
test/116_064_001_02_09.png "was as destitute of this quality as the most ignorant of his coun-
test/116_064_001_02_10.png -"trymen. "It is an extraordinary fact, that even their children, who
test/116_064_001_02_11.png "had been bred among the white people, and who, from being
test/116_064_001_02_12.png "accustomed to follow their manner of living, might have been
test/116_064_001_02_13.png "supposed to ill relish the life of their parents, when grown up,
test/116_064_001_02_14.png "have quitted their comfortable abodes, females as well as males,
test/116_064_001_02_15.png "and taken to the same savage mode of living, where the sup-
test/116_064_001_02_16.png -"ply "of food was often precarious, their comforts not to be called
test/116_064_001_02_17.png "such, and their lives perpetually in danger. As a proof of the little
test/116_064_001_02_18.png "personal safety which they enjoyed, a young young woman, the
test/116_064_001_02_19.png "wife of a man named Ye-ra-ni-be , both of whom had been
test/116_064_001_02_20.png "brought up in the settlement from their childhood, was cruelly
test/116_064_001_02_21.png "murdered at the brickfields by her husband, assisted by another
test/116_064_001_02_22.png "native, Cole-be , who first beat her dreadfully about the head (the
test/116_064_001_02_23.png "common mode of chastising their women), and then put an end to
test/116_064_001_02_24.png "her existence by driving a spear through her heart.
test/116_064_001_02_25.png "When spoken to or censured for robbing the maize grounds,
test/116_064_001_02_26.png "these people, to be revenged, were accustomed to assemble in large

test/116_064_001_02_29.png "seldom refused a live corn when they were asked for it. It was
test/116_064_001_02_30.png "imagined that they were stimulated to this destructive conduct by
test/116_064_001_02_31.png "some run-away convicts who were known to be among them at
test/116_064_001_02_32.png "the time of their committing these depravations. In order to get
test/116_064_001_02_33.png "possession of these pests, a proclamation was issued, calling on
test/116_064_001_02_34.png "them by name to surrender themselves within 14 days, declaring

test/115_111_004_02_04.png the consequence? that for each Convict House rent

test/115_111_004_02_06.png On Mr Bentham's plan it comes to £9 a year, and
test/115_111_004_02_07.png that for two years only.
test/115_111_004_02_08.png A plain proof that all idea of refunding was
test/115_111_004_02_09.png out of the question, or rather that it was perfectly
test/115_111_004_02_10.png understood that nothing should be refunded, is, that
test/115_111_004_02_11.png Mr Bentham was, for months together, with the
test/115_111_004_02_12.png privit of Government and at the recommendation of
test/115_111_004_02_13.png Government, in treaty on his own account with the
test/115_111_004_02_14.png Proprietors for the purchase of the Land: Government
test/115_111_004_02_15.png having agreed to advance the purchase money in that
test/115_111_004_02_16.png case to Mr Bentham for a short time. The Pro-
test/115_111_004_02_17.png -prietors not complying; an Act of Parliament for
test/115_111_004_02_18.png this and other purposes was thought necessary: and
test/115_111_004_02_19.png upon that occasion it was, that it was notified to
test/115_111_004_02_20.png Mr Bentham, as the determination of Government,
test/115_111_004_02_21.png that the Ground should be purchased, not on Mr
test/115_111_004_02_22.png Bentham's account, but on the account of Government:
test/115_111_004_02_23.png but that due satisfaction should be made to Mr
test/115_111_004_02_24.png Bentham and his Representatives. No reason was
test/115_111_004_02_25.png assigned for this departure: Mr Bentham's consent to it
test/115_111_004_02_26.png was not called for: it was not given: he was not heard

test/072_050_003_03_01.png Offences against the external Security of the State.
test/072_050_003_04_01.png is commonly distinguished by the name Piracy.
test/072_050_003_04_02.png When an Offence against Property originates in a
test/072_050_003_04_03.png motive of rapacity and not in motives of resentment the
test/072_050_003_04_04.png property of one person will answer the purpose as well
test/072_050_003_04_05.png as another . If therefore the primary mischief of such an Of:
test/072_050_003_04_06.png :fence be confined to a single state, the secondary mischief,
test/072_050_003_04_07.png however, extends itself to all states the members of which
test/072_050_003_04_08.png are likely to come in the offender's way. An act of Piracy is
test/072_050_003_04_09.png therefore commonly looked upon as an act of hostility against
test/072_050_003_04_10.png mankind in general . The least therefore which is expected
test/072_050_003_04_11.png from the State of which the Pirate is a member is that
test/072_050_003_04_12.png it should acquiesce in his being punished : If it happens
test/072_050_003_04_13.png to have any particular means in its hands of punishing
test/072_050_003_04_14.png him , it may also be expected to take an active part in pu=
test/072_050_003_04_15.png :nishing him : as likewise in punishing any accomplices
test/072_050_003_04_16.png he may have ; and in taking any other expedients that
test/072_050_003_04_17.png may occur for preventing the offence . This holds good more
test/072_050_003_04_18.png particularly with regard to accomplices ; because their
test/072_050_003_04_19.png residence will frequently be upon land within the domi=

test/115_009_002_02_05.png -dequate to each man's desires.
test/115_009_002_02_06.png 2. To keep them clad in a state of lightness & neat-
test/115_009_002_02_07.png -ness, superior to what is usual among the lower clas-
test/115_009_002_02_08.png -ses or even in the improved prisons.
test/115_009_002_02_09.png 3rd To keep them supplied with separate beds and
test/115_009_002_02_10.png bedding, competent to their situation, and in a state
test/115_009_002_02_11.png of cleanliness scarce any where conjoined with liberty.
test/115_009_002_02_12.png 4th To insure to them a sufficient supply of artificial
test/115_009_002_02_13.png warmth and light, whenever the season renders it
test/115_009_002_02_14.png necessary, and thereby preserve them from being
test/115_009_002_02_15.png obliged as in other places, to desist from their work,
test/115_009_002_02_16.png as well as from suffering from the inclemency of
test/115_009_002_02_17.png the weather.
test/115_009_002_02_18.png 5.th To keep constantly from them, in conformity to the
test/115_009_002_02_19.png practice so happily received, every kind of strong &
test/115_009_002_02_20.png spirituous liquor, unless where ordered in the way of
test/115_009_002_02_21.png medicine.
test/115_009_002_02_22.png 6th To maintain them in a state of inviolable
test/115_009_002_02_23.png though mitigated seclusion, in small assorted com-
test/115_009_002_02_24.png panies, without any of those opportunities of pro

test/116_387_001_01_03.png Mr Long of the 27th ulto, desiring, by command of

test/116_387_001_01_06.png Mr Bentham, is intended to accommodate. I have
test/116_387_001_01_07.png examined the Acts of the 19th & 34th of his present
test/116_387_001_01_08.png Majesty, relative to the building of Penitentiary Houses
test/116_387_001_01_09.png for confining and employing in hard labour, Persons
test/116_387_001_01_10.png convicted of transportable and other Crimes.
test/116_387_001_01_11.png I understand the object of these Acts to be, that
test/116_387_001_01_12.png such Penitentiary Houses should be used principally
test/116_387_001_01_13.png as receptacles for such transportable Convicts as the

test/071_181_004_04_04.png At first sight it may appear hard that a fraud upon
test/071_181_004_04_05.png an Article of so small a value as the Copper Coin should be
test/071_181_004_04_06.png punished as severely as a fraud upon one of so high a value
test/071_181_004_04_07.png as the Silver or even the Gold Coin, since the profit that
test/071_181_004_04_08.png may be made by the falsifying any piece of the less precious
test/071_181_004_04_09.png metal is not near so great as that which may be made
test/071_181_004_04_10.png by the falsifying of the more precious metal. But the case
test/071_181_004_04_11.png here is that the mischief is not to be estimated from the ef=
test/071_181_004_04_12.png :fects of a single Act but from the effects of the Habit. Now
test/071_181_004_04_13.png when the Habit is taken into the Account the one practice
test/071_181_004_04_14.png does not seem to demand in any considerable degree a great=
test/071_181_004_04_15.png :er punishment than the other. Where the profit upon a
test/071_181_004_04_16.png single piece is the greatest, the difficulty of getting it off is
test/071_181_004_04_17.png the greatest. The profit upon a base shilling may, it is

test/073_083_001_03_01.png Where the quantity of damage which was intended is the
test/073_083_001_03_02.png very quantity which eventually ensues, the act may be said

test/073_083_001_03_05.png more than adequately
test/073_083_001_03_06.png You intended for instance to strike the porter,
test/073_083_001_03_07.png whose leg you have broken. If
test/073_083_001_03_08.png If your intention was to strike him in the leg in such

test/073_083_001_03_11.png that he might be obliged to have his fore-arm cut off, and the
test/073_083_001_03_12.png case is that the damage he would suffer from the loss of a

test/073_083_001_03_14.png would suffer from the loss of a fore-arm, in either of these
test/073_083_001_03_15.png cases the act was adequately intentional with regard to

test/073_083_001_03_17.png If your intention was only to hurt him in the fore-

test/116_286_002_02_01.png The design was _ that Convicts once sent there should

test/116_286_002_02_03.png such thing, about the return of Convicts, would have been
test/116_286_002_02_04.png dictated either by what I call justice (in which case it would
test/116_286_002_02_05.png have run counter to the design) or by the supposed profitable
test/116_286_002_02_06.png injustice. On the former supposition, arrangements would have been
test/116_286_002_02_07.png taken in the first place, for preventing the emigration of each
test/116_286_002_02_08.png Convict before the expiration of his legal terms of punishment_
test/116_286_002_02_09.png in the next place, for affording him the means of quitting the

test/116_286_002_02_11.png -rangements, if not of the positive cast, at any rate of the negative
test/116_286_002_02_12.png viz: by removing from that time forwards whatever
test/116_286_002_02_13.png obstacle might till then have been opposed as such to his escape.
