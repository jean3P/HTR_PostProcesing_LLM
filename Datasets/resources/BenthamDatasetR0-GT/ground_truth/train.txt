train/071_167_001_05_03.png will be put to two great charges , 1 . The Loss upon the wear and
train/071_167_001_05_04.png the debasement . 2 . The expence of the Operation .
train/071_167_001_05_05.png But the first Loss must be born by somebody : and it
train/071_167_001_05_06.png is better it should be born by the state , than by individuals . It
train/071_167_001_05_07.png is better , for the same reason that Inssurance Offices are beneficial .
train/071_167_001_05_08.png The burthen by being reduced as it were to impalpable parcels

train/116_291_001_04_03.png -emplification of the spirit of injustice with which the whole system
train/116_291_001_04_04.png is impregnated . It was not enough to stretch into a perpetual

train/116_625_001_02_36.png a motive , give birth in his Grace ' s mind to a determination
train/116_625_001_02_37.png to grant the relief they pra pray for . Little did they expect
train/116_625_001_02_38.png to see the day , & that so early a one , in which by a document

train/116_294_002_02_01.png exhilerating assurance , and afterwards , by instruction from his

train/116_294_002_02_03.png revoked it accordingly , the case would have been intelligible e-
train/116_294_002_02_04.png -nough . But here no such assurance is given until the very
train/116_294_002_02_05.png time when , spontaneously or under instructions , a resolution is
train/116_294_002_02_06.png taken not to fulfill it .
train/116_294_002_02_07.png N . 10 ( p . 268 ) Feb 1793 . At this time the expectation about
train/116_294_002_02_08.png " the clause .. . in the chapter party " for preventing Shipmasters from
train/116_294_002_02_09.png " receiving any person " whatever on board " from the Colony , without
train/116_294_002_02_10.png " the express consent and order of the Governor " was found to be
train/116_294_002_02_11.png l
train/116_294_002_02_12.png realized . The Bel ona , arrived 15th January 1793 came provided
train/116_294_002_02_13.png with this clause . She had sailed from England on the 8th of
train/116_294_002_02_14.png August 1792 . The " improved " Colony was thus improved into
train/116_294_002_02_15.png a pretty compleat Bastile : a key only being put into the
train/116_294_002_02_16.png hand of the Governor with liberty to let loose any person whom
train/116_294_002_02_17.png he might be induced to favour . Into the jaws of this Bastile
train/116_294_002_02_18.png came out by this same vessel several free and honest families .
train/116_294_002_02_19.png They had been inveigled hither by conditions held out by govern-
train/116_294_002_02_20.png -ment . These conditions are stated by Captain Collins ( p . 267 . )
train/116_294_002_02_21.png Among these conditions I do not observe that of being dependent
train/116_294_002_02_22.png for their return on the arbitrary will and pleasure of a suc-

train/116_294_002_02_26.png given in the preceding August , as mentioned in N . 9 , began
train/116_294_002_02_27.png now to manifest itself . On this day sailed for Canton this

train/116_133_001_02_06.png the people , to be summoned as aforesaid , to make , constitute

train/116_133_001_02_12.png p . 208 . A great deal has been said , and many authorities
train/116_133_001_02_13.png cited relative to propositions , in which both sides seem to be
train/116_133_001_02_14.png perfectly agreed ; and which indeed are too clear to be
train/116_133_001_02_15.png controverted . The stating some of those propositions which
train/116_133_001_02_16.png we think quite clear , will lead us to see with greater
train/116_133_001_02_17.png perspicuity , what is the question upon the first point ,
train/116_133_001_02_18.png and upon what hinge it turns . I will state the propositions
train/116_133_001_02_19.png at large .
train/116_133_001_02_20.png p . 208 The 4th , That the law and legislative government of
train/116_133_001_02_21.png every dominion , equally affects all persons and all property
train/116_133_001_02_22.png within the limits thereof ; and is the rule of decision for
train/116_133_001_02_23.png all questions which arise there . Whoever purchases , lives ,
train/116_133_001_02_24.png or ones there , puts himself under the law of the place .
train/116_133_001_02_25.png An Englishman in Ireland , Minorca , the Isle of Man , or the
train/116_133_001_02_26.png Plantations , has no privilege distinct from the natives .
train/116_133_001_02_27.png p 209 . The 6th , and last proposition is , that if the kings ,
train/116_133_001_02_28.png ( and when I say the king , I always mean the king , without
train/116_133_001_02_29.png the concurrence of parliament ) has a power to alter the old
train/116_133_001_02_30.png and to introduce new laws in a conquered country , this
train/116_133_001_02_31.png legislation being subordinate , that is , subordinate to his
train/116_133_001_02_32.png own authority in parliament , he cannot make any new
train/116_133_001_02_33.png change contrary to fundamental principles : he cannot
train/116_133_001_02_34.png exempt an inhabitant from that particular dominion ;
train/116_133_001_02_35.png as for instance , from the laws of trade , or from the
train/116_133_001_02_36.png power of parliament , or give him privileges exclusive
train/116_133_001_02_37.png of his other subjects ; and so in many other instances
train/116_133_001_02_38.png which might be put . _

train/071_035_003_04_02.png The value of a new service occur ing in an old office is to be

train/071_035_003_05_05.png In as far as a Legislator authorizes an officer to take

train/071_035_003_06_01.png An officer is to be deemed to have given the party

train/072_050_001_03_01.png Offences against the external Security of the State .
train/072_050_001_04_01.png Now let us consider the case where the party in :
train/072_050_001_04_02.png : jured is a privileged member of a state in amity . For
train/072_050_001_04_03.png the sake of the intercourse carried on between one state
train/072_050_001_04_04.png and another when at amity it has been the custom to
train/072_050_001_04_05.png invest those by whose means it is carried on , with par=
train/072_050_001_04_06.png : ticular distinctions . Such persons are known by diffe=
train/072_050_001_04_07.png : rent names according to their different ranks : but they
train/072_050_001_04_08.png are also known all together by the common appellation
train/072_050_001_04_09.png of Foreign Ministers . Were a person permitted to do an
train/072_050_001_04_10.png injury to these great officers at no higher a price than
train/072_050_001_04_11.png it would cost him to do the like injury to an ordinary
train/072_050_001_04_12.png person , it is evident enough that on various occasions
train/072_050_001_04_13.png the interests of both states might suffer in a very high
train/072_050_001_04_14.png degree by the interruption which such outrages might
train/072_050_001_04_15.png occasion in the management of their concerns . Even
train/072_050_001_04_16.png in cases where no material interruption might ensue
train/072_050_001_04_17.png to such concerns , the pride as well of sovereigns whose

train/072_050_002_04_01.png constitutes perhaps the most immediate and universal
train/072_050_002_04_02.png reason for giving an extraordinary degree of protection
train/072_050_002_04_03.png to these privileged foreigners against all injuries what=
train/072_050_002_04_04.png : soever .
train/072_050_002_04_05.png To appease that resentment , an obvious expedient
train/072_050_002_04_06.png is to deliver up to the Sovereign of the injured State all
train/072_050_002_04_07.png have been
train/072_050_002_04_08.png persons whatsoever who were concerned in the injury of=

train/072_050_002_04_10.png scarcely fail of being effectual in any case ; and though
train/072_050_002_04_11.png in most cases it may not be necessary , yet as there
train/072_050_002_04_12.png may be cases in which nothing less will serve , it is fit
train/072_050_002_04_13.png that a power should be given to the judicial Magistrate
train/072_050_002_04_14.png to put it in practice if ever the Security of the State
train/072_050_002_04_15.png should call for such a sacrifice .

train/096_002_003_02_03.png Our Author seems to have been led into this
train/096_002_003_02_04.png inaccurate use of the term law , by a servile
train/096_002_003_02_05.png imitation of Montesquieu . Montesquieu
train/096_002_003_02_06.png had said before him , " Tous les êtres ont leurs
train/096_002_003_02_07.png " loix , la divinitè a ses loix , le monde mate=

train/096_002_003_02_10.png " loix , l ' homme a ses loix . " But then
train/096_002_003_02_11.png Montesquieu had given a different diff
train/096_002_003_02_12.png definition of law : he had said , " les loix sont les
train/096_002_003_02_13.png " rapports , qui derivent de la nature des choses . "
train/096_002_003_02_14.png and , supposing this definition to be just ,
train/096_002_003_02_15.png his
train/096_002_003_02_16.png supposing it not to have mistaken the
train/096_002_003_02_17.png foundation of Law , for Law itself , then

train/071_184_002_04_05.png it might appear . By himself a man of a given rank of life for=
train/071_184_002_04_06.png : tune and occupation cannot , without being detected , circulate
train/071_184_002_04_07.png more Coin that it will be expected should be disbursed by a
train/071_184_002_04_08.png as his appears to be
train/071_184_002_04_09.png man of such rank , fortune , and reputation : and , of the Coin which
train/071_184_002_04_10.png he does circulate , certainly it is not the whole that can be bad
train/071_184_002_04_11.png Coin of his own coining . What he can circulate of this bad
train/071_184_002_04_12.png Coin without being detected , will even bear but a small
train/071_184_002_04_13.png ratio to the whole of the coin he circulates . It is true , that
train/071_184_002_04_14.png by continually changing the people with whom he deals , and
train/071_184_002_04_15.png thus contriving always to have strangers to deal with , he may
train/071_184_002_04_16.png circulate more and more : but the circulation even when this
train/071_184_002_04_17.png method is taken to extend it , has still its bounds . In the
train/071_184_002_04_18.png first place the being perpetually employed in finding out new
train/071_184_002_04_19.png persons to deal with will take up a considerable degree
train/071_184_002_04_20.png of time . In the next place he must , upon an average , expend

train/071_184_003_04_03.png The time which it will necessarily take him up
train/071_184_003_04_04.png to find fit persons to deal with will be so much time taken

train/071_184_003_04_11.png together that appear to be of the same die this circumstance
train/071_184_003_04_12.png may of itself be sufficient to fix a considerable degree of
train/071_184_003_04_13.png suspicion on a person of such an occupation . He can sel=

train/071_184_003_04_15.png If he procures many different moulds or stamps this will
train/071_184_003_04_16.png in proportion take up more expence and time . Bad money
train/071_184_003_04_17.png is in general more liable to suspicion the fresher it is ; for
train/071_184_003_04_18.png the fresher they both are , the more easy it is to discover
train/071_184_003_04_19.png those minute differences by which bad Coin is distinguishable

train/116_279_001_03_04.png 1 . That he has not only assumed , but concurred in the
train/116_279_001_03_05.png exercise of , a dispensing power , by advancing positions tending
train/116_279_001_03_06.png to warrant him in defeating _ and defeating accordingly _ the
train/116_279_001_03_07.png the sole object of the Act of 1794 , by which a Penitentiary estab-
train/116_279_001_03_08.png -lishment was required to be set on foot : and , in so doing ,
train/116_279_001_03_09.png has been guilty of an illegal exercise of legislative power , a-
train/116_279_001_03_10.png -mounting in its effects to the repeal of an imperative law

train/116_279_001_03_15.png in cases in which that mode of punishment was , by Par-

train/116_279_001_03_17.png has been guilty of another illegal exercise of legislative power ,
train/116_279_001_03_18.png amounting in its effects to the enactment of a positive impera-

train/116_279_001_03_20.png 3 . That , in another instance , he has assumed at any

train/071_146_001_04_12.png Exposition
train/071_146_001_05_01.png Note .
train/071_146_001_05_02.png ( a ) The term Sharping is rather a low expression .
train/071_146_001_05_03.png In general however it seems preferable to Fraudulent
train/071_146_001_05_04.png obtainment , exhibiting the same idea by a single
train/071_146_001_05_05.png word . Besides that Sharping has the conjugate Sharp=
train/071_146_001_05_06.png : er to express the Agent : and the expression Frau=
train/071_146_001_05_07.png : dulent obtainment has no such conjugate to answer
train/071_146_001_05_08.png to
train/071_146_001_05_09.png it . In point of signification the term filouterie in
train/071_146_001_05_10.png French seems to answer to it exactly : the originati=
train/071_146_001_05_11.png : on of the two words , though somewhat different ,
train/071_146_001_05_12.png is still analogous . In both cases the immaterial
train/071_146_001_05_13.png idea that is meant to be typified is that of
train/071_146_001_05_14.png cunning . But the material image employed for
train/071_146_001_05_15.png that purpose is in the English , that of sharpness ;
train/071_146_001_05_16.png as in the words acuteness , and acumen : in the
train/071_146_001_05_17.png it seems to be

train/115_087_002_02_28.png of the 19th of his Majesty Chapter 74 , the same would

train/096_052_001_01_01.png Law in General . ( 5
train/096_052_001_02_01.png for the Law giver is somewhat curious : Beside man , the following

train/096_052_001_02_09.png and it was this no-meaning
train/096_052_001_02_10.png is that they have no meaning ; that our Author seems to have depended
train/096_052_001_02_11.png on to save them from being seen to have a false one . That Clocks _
train/096_052_001_02_12.png have Laws prescribed or dictated to them : is a proposition , which
train/096_052_001_02_13.png without sense
train/096_052_001_02_14.png so long as men content themselves with sounds , may pass for true :
train/096_052_001_02_15.png but so soon as any precise import is given to these words , must be
train/096_052_001_02_16.png seen plainly to be false .
train/096_052_001_02_17.png What is said of Law in general , we naturally expect to find agree _
train/096_052_001_02_18.png with each sort of Law in particular : For what agrees with the Genus
train/096_052_001_02_19.png No
train/096_052_001_02_20.png agrees with every Species . There is not a Rule of Logic better known
train/096_052_001_02_21.png truth
train/096_052_001_02_22.png and untutored common sense bears testimony to the justice of it .
train/096_052_001_02_23.png For it is but a declaration of the sense that all mankind who care
train/096_052_001_02_24.png the words Genus and species , and know what they are saying , put up
train/096_052_001_02_25.png on those words . A thing that is given for a Law is not a species of Law
train/096_052_001_02_26.png if any thing that can be said of Law in general , that is of all Laws
train/096_052_001_02_27.png cannot be said of that . A plant that is given for a Rose is not a
train/096_052_001_02_28.png species of Rose , if any thing can be said of the genus Rose that is of
train/096_052_001_02_29.png all roses , can not be said of that .

train/073_055_001_03_11.png Instances only , whilst in others it is confounded with
train/073_055_001_03_12.png it , is the Offence of Embezzlement .
train/073_055_001_03_13.png Embezzlement is where a Man having

train/116_301_002_02_01.png confinement any where in England two things require here
train/116_301_002_02_02.png to be observed - 1st That it would be no more than the
train/116_301_002_02_03.png fulfillment of promises already made : 2nd That being but
train/116_301_002_02_04.png being a compliance with the respective laws it is no more
train/116_301_002_02_05.png than what used to take place under the do transportation
train/116_301_002_02_06.png system- no more than would have taken place had
train/116_301_002_02_07.png there never been any such Colony as New South Wales .
train/116_301_002_02_08.png Notwithstanding this , there is , it must be confessed , in the
train/116_301_002_02_09.png idea of such influx of something that can scarce fail
train/116_301_002_02_10.png terror
train/116_301_002_02_11.png to strike a sort of horror into every breast that thinks of it .
train/116_301_002_02_12.png This terror , so far as it is inspired by reason
train/116_301_002_02_13.png and reflection , has two main grounds , which distinguish
train/116_301_002_02_14.png the exigency in question from former times . Under the origi-
train/116_301_002_02_15.png -nal transportation system , a great part were reformed ( I
train/116_301_002_02_16.png have stated elsewhere by what causes ) of whom again a
train/116_301_002_02_17.png great part , perhaps the greatest part , staid abroad : and ,
train/116_301_002_02_18.png whether reformed or not , those who did return dropped in
train/116_301_002_02_19.png gradually , and in small numbers , as their terms expired .
train/116_301_002_02_20.png Under Mr Pitt ' s system , they have been almost without
train/116_301_002_02_21.png exception , worse corrupted than before : and , where the
train/116_301_002_02_22.png unbending rules of strict justice to be obeyed , the accumulated
train/116_301_002_02_23.png corruption of so many years would come pouring into the
train/116_301_002_02_24.png country all at once _
train/116_301_002_02_25.png Such being the knot , what course can be taken , for
train/116_301_002_02_26.png the untying , or even the cutting it ? _
train/116_301_002_02_27.png Expedients certainly have occurred to me , by which a

train/072_066_003_04_12.png to get work that a man continues without employment ,
train/072_066_003_04_13.png he will be glad to go there , and get it : if it be from

train/072_066_003_04_17.png him as we have seen , into all sorts of offences , it is very
train/072_066_003_04_18.png suffer for it . Now to make him suffer for it in the

train/116_288_001_03_11.png very time ( as we learn from the paragraph next before the

train/115_112_001_02_06.png Article 1 . Already acceded to at the first word ,
train/115_112_001_02_07.png and for the reasons given by Mr Ford .
train/115_112_001_02_08.png Article 2 . Mr Bentham would be very glad
train/115_112_001_02_09.png to be rid , even at some hazard , of the delays and
train/115_112_001_02_10.png difficulties attending the making of an exact esti-
train/115_112_001_02_11.png -mate . From such view as he has been able to
train/115_112_001_02_12.png obtain of the matter , he cannot consent willingly
train/115_112_001_02_13.png to accept of so little as the £30,000 . He would
train/115_112_001_02_14.png be satisfied with a thousand more . The two first
train/115_112_001_02_15.png installments would then stand £12,000 amd £12,000 ,
train/115_112_001_02_16.png instead of £10,000 and £10,000 : the last instalment
train/115_112_001_02_17.png payable on the reception of the Prisoners to re-

train/116_291_002_02_02.png to their liberty of departure , before the month of August 1792 : being
train/116_291_002_02_03.png the time at which the intelligence was received , of the Instructions
train/116_291_002_02_04.png subjecting it to his will and pleasure .
train/116_291_002_02_05.png No . 1 ( p . 74 ) July 1789 . The situation in which Expirees in
train/116_291_002_02_06.png general now found themselves placed has been already stated .
train/116_291_002_02_07.png By one individual in particular , an experimental proof of the
train/116_291_002_02_08.png nature of the situation was at this same time received . The
train/116_291_002_02_09.png only evidence by which the Governor ' s right to confine any body
train/116_291_002_02_10.png in New South Wales could be established not being forth-

train/116_291_002_02_12.png that his time of punishment was expired , claimed his liberty .
train/116_291_002_02_13.png For the course of his argument , having used some words which
train/116_291_002_02_14.png though not mentioned were deemed " disrespectful to the
train/116_291_002_02_15.png " Lieutenant Governor " , he was punished with six hundred lashes ,
train/116_291_002_02_16.png and kept in irons for six months . A very instructive example
train/116_291_002_02_17.png certainly : it showed more what was to be got by talking about rights .
train/116_291_002_02_18.png No . 2 ( p . 130 ) August 1790 . Another freeman trying to quit the
train/116_291_002_02_19.png Colony punished " for taking a very improper mode " . The act itself
train/116_291_002_02_20.png consisted in the exercise of that liberty which the law of the land
train/116_291_002_02_21.png had saved to him , and which no man alive had any right so
train/116_291_002_02_22.png much as to pretend to give him leave to exercise . The impropriety
train/116_291_002_02_23.png of the mode consisted in the not asking leave , at the risk of
train/116_291_002_02_24.png receiving six hundred lashes and wearing irons for six months .
train/116_291_002_02_25.png Mode of punishment of course flogging though not mentioned :
train/116_291_002_02_26.png number of lashes not mentioned . This freeman " was punished to-

train/116_291_002_02_28.png in the same ship at the same time . As far as can be judged ,
train/116_291_002_02_29.png right or no right made no sort of difference .

train/071_202_001_04_16.png to permit them to do it in a peaceable manner . The

train/115_110_004_03_07.png have to leave his Representatives with a burthen
train/115_110_004_03_08.png of such a weight hanging over their heads .
train/115_110_004_03_09.png Mr Ford will easily conceive , that the Building ,
train/115_110_004_03_10.png though a considerable part , is nothing nigh the
train/115_110_004_03_11.png whole of the expence at coming in . Fitting up &
train/115_110_004_03_12.png furnishing , especially the apartments of the Officers ,
train/115_110_004_03_13.png Clerks , &c , who will be very numerous , stocking the
train/115_110_004_03_14.png Manufactories and the Hospital , Cloathing ( an article
train/115_110_004_03_15.png which must come heavy at first before there are
train/115_110_004_03_16.png old cloaths to serve for working ) All this , besides
train/115_110_004_03_17.png a new invented system of machinery , which , though
train/115_110_004_03_18.png not half compleated for such a number , has already
train/115_110_004_03_19.png cost several thousand pounds . So far therefore from
train/115_110_004_03_20.png having been understood that the £15,000 was all of it
train/115_110_004_03_21.png for the building , it is not true , nor any thing like
train/115_110_004_03_22.png true . Mr Campbel ' s charge , as appears from the
train/115_110_004_03_23.png Reports of the House of Commons , was at the
train/115_110_004_03_24.png rate of £30,000 instead of the £27,000 and that

train/072_168_001_03_01.png Of Personal Insults .
train/072_168_001_04_01.png ( A )
train/072_168_001_04_02.png A personal insult is where a man is concerned in doing
train/072_168_001_04_03.png or attempting to do any thing to the person of another in the in=
train/072_168_001_04_04.png ( B ) towards
train/072_168_001_04_05.png : tention of expressing contempt from him or exposing him to
train/072_168_001_04_06.png the contempt of others .
train/072_168_001_04_07.png Exposition .
train/072_168_001_04_08.png [ ( A ) Concerned ] See Tit . Of Co-offenders .
train/072_168_001_04_09.png As by
train/072_168_001_04_10.png [ ( B ) Expressing Contempt . ] 1 . By spitting in his face , kicking
train/072_168_001_04_11.png him , rolling him in the kennel . There are an infinity of ways of
train/072_168_001_04_12.png expressing Contempt for a man : and they are liable to be ex=
train/072_168_001_04_13.png : pressive of a greater or less degree of contempt according to the
train/072_168_001_04_14.png different manners and customs of the people .
train/072_168_001_04_15.png 2 . Every personal Insult is a personal Injury or an attempt
train/072_168_001_04_16.png to offer a personal Injury : and in general the less atrocious an
train/072_168_001_04_17.png offence is in the character of a simple personal injury , the more atro=
train/072_168_001_04_18.png : cious it is in that of a personal insult : since the slighter the bo=
train/072_168_001_04_19.png : dily pain in which you put a man to , the plainer it is that the
train/072_168_001_04_20.png end you had in mind was the exposing him to contempt . If for
train/072_168_001_04_21.png instance it was by striking him a heavy blow with a Club or an
train/072_168_001_04_22.png Iron bar , or by wounding him with a sword or knife , that You
train/072_168_001_04_23.png sought

train/071_181_003_03_01.png Of Frauds relative to the Coin .
train/071_181_003_04_01.png Coin . It may happen that but a few are in this case ; but
train/071_181_003_04_02.png it may happen that all are in the same case . It depends
train/071_181_003_04_03.png upon the degree of currency which the foreign Coin in ques=
train/071_181_003_04_04.png : tion may happen to have . Besides by knowing that a
train/071_181_003_04_05.png fraud has been practised upon that Coin they know that there
train/071_181_003_04_06.png is a criminal who has the inclination and the power to do
train/071_181_003_04_07.png mischief in this way , or " yesterday " they will say to themselves ,
train/071_181_003_04_08.png " he practised it upon foreign Coin ; but to morrow he may
train/071_181_003_04_09.png practise it upon our own .
train/071_181_003_04_10.png 3 . The Profit is just the same : for the gain of half a
train/071_181_003_04_11.png for example ,
train/071_181_003_04_12.png crown , upon a Guinea is neither more nor less than that of half
train/071_181_003_04_13.png a crown upon a louis-dor .
train/071_181_003_04_14.png If an Offender thinks he can get off counterfeit foreign Coin
train/071_181_003_04_15.png he will counterfeit foreign Coin ; if he does not think he can
train/071_181_003_04_16.png get off counterfeit domestic Coin , he will not counterfeit do=
train/071_181_003_04_17.png : mestic Coin .
train/071_181_003_04_18.png Lastly 1 . The danger of detection is much upon a Par . There
train/071_181_003_04_19.png materially
train/071_181_003_04_20.png seems no reason to be given why it should be greater
train/071_181_003_04_21.png in the one case than in the other .

train/115_110_002_03_02.png behalf of Government out of the value of
train/115_110_002_03_03.png the Premises &c in consideration of the said
train/115_110_002_03_04.png sum of £15,000 , and the amount of the
train/115_110_002_03_05.png agregate sum the said payments of £18 may
train/115_110_002_03_06.png be estimated at .
train/115_110_002_04_01.png Article 22 . Had Mr Ford had any sufficient
train/115_110_002_04_02.png opportunity of being acquainted with the history of
train/115_110_002_04_03.png the treaty , Mr Bentham cannot but flatter himself
train/115_110_002_04_04.png that what appears now to him as a hardship
train/115_110_002_04_05.png upon Government would have appeared to him in a
train/115_110_002_04_06.png different light . A proposition that seems to be
train/115_110_002_04_07.png tacitly assumed is , that the money in question
train/115_110_002_04_08.png is so much clear money out of the pocket of
train/115_110_002_04_09.png Government on account of Mr Bentham ' s plan ,
train/115_110_002_04_10.png over and above what it would have paid otherwise :
train/115_110_002_04_11.png Whereas ( except as to an article of £6000 of which
train/115_110_002_04_12.png presently ) Government is at no expence at all

train/071_185_003_05_02.png ( a ) In England with respect to the counterfeiting of the copper coin
train/071_185_003_05_03.png in particular few are sufferers by it , but with their eyes open . By much
train/071_185_003_05_04.png the greatest part of the counterfeit money is so palpably unlike , the im=
train/071_185_003_05_05.png : posture is so gross , that it cannot pass upon any body who thinks it
train/071_185_003_05_06.png worth his while to examine it with ever so little attention : so that the
train/071_185_003_05_07.png mischief , though extensive , is not so great as one would imagine and the
train/071_185_003_05_08.png low price of the metal effectually secures it against any contrivance that
train/071_185_003_05_09.png could be employed for diminishing what is genuine .
train/096_008_004_01_01.png code of laws , yet knowing that it has never
train/096_008_004_01_02.png been published to his people , that they have
train/096_008_004_01_03.png no possible means of attaining to the know

train/096_008_004_01_07.png part of his people , exacting , mean while ,
train/096_008_004_01_08.png obedience to it from all . This , I repeat it , is
train/096_008_004_01_09.png exactly what our author ( I must say im-
train/096_008_004_01_10.png piously ) dares to suppose of the Creator of the

train/071_128_001_04_01.png We come now to the second class of offences : consisting
train/071_128_001_04_02.png of such as are of a semi public nature : and in the first place
train/071_128_001_04_03.png to offences through calamity .
train/071_128_001_05_01.png Semi-public Offences , or Offences against a class of persons may
train/071_128_001_05_02.png be distinguished in the first place into offences against a local class of
train/071_128_001_05_03.png persons , or , in other words , into offences against a Neighborhood , and
train/071_128_001_05_04.png Offences against an ideal class of persons , or in other words offences a=
train/071_128_001_05_05.png =gainst a class of persons at large . By the former I mean all such
train/071_128_001_05_06.png offences which a multitude of persons are exposed to suffer on account
train/071_128_001_05_07.png of the proximity of the divisions of space which they happen res=
train/071_128_001_05_08.png : pectively to occupy for the time being : that proximity being a
train/071_128_001_05_09.png circumstance which denominates them neighbours to each other
train/071_128_001_05_10.png and the whole tract of ground they occupy , the Neighbourhood . By
train/071_128_001_05_11.png the latter I mean all offences which any such multitude of persons
train/071_128_001_05_12.png are exposed to suffer by , as happen to be connected and brought
train/071_128_001_05_13.png into the same predicament by any other circumstance .
train/071_128_001_05_14.png Offences against a Neighbourhood may be distinguished in the
train/071_128_001_05_15.png first place into such as are first rate crimes and such as are only offenc=
train/071_128_001_05_16.png =es of an inferior rank . Under the former division I comprehend
train/071_128_001_05_17.png the two Offences for which language has found names to wit Incen=
train/071_128_001_05_18.png =diarism and Inundation . These will be treated of in form , each
train/071_128_001_05_19.png under a title by itself . They are in fact but so many particular

train/071_106_002_04_04.png But popular prejudice is seldom perfectly equitable to

train/071_106_002_04_07.png a Woman thus imposed upon suffers in her fortune . Perhaps
train/071_106_002_04_08.png she had none : the only bait that tempted the Offender was her
train/071_106_002_04_09.png person . It is only in case of her having had a fortune , and
train/071_106_002_04_10.png that fortune ' s having been dissipated by the Offender , that she
train/071_106_002_04_11.png is a sufferer in this way . In the account of dissipation , so

train/115_011_001_02_05.png The author , having turned his thoughts to the
train/115_011_001_02_06.png Penitentiary System from its first origin , and having
train/115_011_001_02_07.png lately contrived a building in which any number

train/115_011_001_02_09.png -spected during every moment of their lives , and
train/115_011_001_02_10.png having made out as he flatters himself to demonstration
train/115_011_001_02_11.png that the only eligible mode of managing an establishment
train/115_011_001_02_12.png of such a nature in a building of such construction
train/115_011_001_02_13.png would be by contract , has been induced to make public
train/115_011_001_02_14.png the following proposal for maintaining and employ-
train/115_011_001_02_15.png -ing convicts in general , or such of them as would other-
train/115_011_001_02_16.png -wise be confined on board the Hulks , for per Cent
train/115_011_001_02_17.png less than it costs Government to maintain them
train/115_011_001_02_18.png there at present , deducting also the average value
train/115_011_001_02_19.png by them
train/115_011_001_02_20.png of the work at present performed Government : _ _ _
train/115_011_001_02_21.png upon the terms of his receiving the produce of

train/115_011_001_02_25.png that the abatement and deduction abovementi-
train/115_011_001_02_26.png -oned shall be suspended for the first year .
train/115_011_001_02_27.png Upon the abovementioned terms he would engage
train/115_011_001_02_28.png as follows .
train/115_011_001_02_29.png 1.st To furnish the Prisoners with a constant supply
train/115_011_001_02_30.png of wholesome food , [ not limited in quantity , but ade-
train/115_011_001_02_31.png -quate to each man ' s desires . ]
train/115_011_001_02_32.png 2nd To keep them clad in a state of tightness and neat-
train/115_011_001_02_33.png -ness [ superior to what is usual among the lower
train/115_011_001_02_34.png classes or even in the improved prisons . ]
train/115_011_001_02_35.png 3rd To keep them supplied with separate beds and bed-
train/115_011_001_02_36.png -ding competent to their situation , and in a state
train/115_011_001_02_37.png of cleanliness [ scarce any where conjoined with li-

train/096_017_003_01_01.png To be copied
train/096_017_003_02_01.png and only so far , as they are admitted by the
train/096_017_003_02_02.png laws of the land .
train/096_017_003_02_03.png Had our Author consulted the history of other
train/096_017_003_02_04.png nations , he would have seen , into what incon-
train/096_017_003_02_05.png -veniences , errors , and absurdities , the Jews , the

train/096_017_003_02_08.png -founding the extent of the operation of civil , and
train/096_017_003_02_09.png religious laws . Had he looked into the history
train/096_017_003_02_10.png of our own country , he would have known
train/096_017_003_02_11.png seen learnt , that the pretences of many of

train/072_054_002_03_01.png Offences against the National Interest in general .
train/072_054_002_04_01.png A caution to the Legislator _ This title is a very ample one , as
train/072_054_002_04_02.png such a very loose one and on that account very liable to be abused . It
train/072_054_002_04_03.png would be abusing it , if he made use of it for a receptacle for such
train/072_054_002_04_04.png acts as he could not discover to be productive of any particular
train/072_054_002_04_05.png kind of mischief . There is in short but one case in which he can
train/072_054_002_04_06.png stand justified , for putting any kind of act under this title ; that
train/072_054_002_04_07.png is where the same sort of act is liable at one time to be produc=
train/072_054_002_04_08.png : tive of mischief in one way , at another time of another : but at
train/072_054_002_04_09.png any rate in some one or other of the ways specified under the pre=
train/072_054_002_04_10.png : ceding titles . If not he has no better warrant for putting it
train/072_054_002_04_11.png here than any where else . At present when a Legislator has a
train/072_054_002_04_12.png mind to punish an act , and he cannot tell why , he calls it an
train/072_054_002_04_13.png offence against good order . Let him take care that the class here in
train/072_054_002_04_14.png question be not made the same ill use of .
train/072_054_002_04_15.png Among the Offences which can with propriety be placed
train/072_054_002_04_16.png upon this uncertain ground I can find no other than the following :
train/072_054_002_04_17.png 1 . Taking without leave of the government a pension or present from

train/116_648_001_03_12.png Peace with the Republic of France _
train/116_648_001_03_13.png . . . A detailed & most masterly exposition of these is to be found
train/116_648_001_03_14.png in Mr Pitt ' s speech of the 3 Feby 1800 , in which among other particulars ,
train/116_648_001_03_15.png an account is given of his proceedings toward the people and govern-
train/116_648_001_03_16.png -ments of the several states of Milan , Modena , Genoa , Tuscany , the
train/116_648_001_03_17.png Pope , Venice , & Egypt . Of all these things it may be said generally , & as
train/116_648_001_03_18.png it should seem without exception , _ such was purposely the profusion of
train/116_648_001_03_19.png engagements , & such the uniform and systematic breach of them , _ that
train/116_648_001_03_20.png not a single act was done , which was not in violation of some engage-
train/116_648_001_03_21.png -ment , & certainly not a single engagement contracted , or profession made ,
train/116_648_001_03_22.png that was not , in every part of it , grossly and in most cases instantly violated .
train/116_648_001_03_23.png The french rulers , have , throughout , evidently acted upon the principle ,
train/116_648_001_03_24.png that he who could divest himself at once of all moral feeling , and
train/116_648_001_03_25.png release himself from all moral controull controul , must for the time
train/116_648_001_03_26.png have an immense advantage over those who should remain under the
train/116_648_001_03_27.png old constraints , and who might not be sensible immediately of the change
train/116_648_001_03_28.png which had taken place , or , when they were , might be long incapable either
train/116_648_001_03_29.png of adopting it into their own conduct , or of so unseating their antient feelings
train/116_648_001_03_30.png and habits ( the habit for instance of relying in some degree on men ' s
train/116_648_001_03_31.png apearances , yielding something to their professions , believing in part what they
train/116_648_001_03_32.png should solemnly assert ) , as to make themselves proof against its effects .
train/116_648_001_03_33.png Nobody has entered more fully into their views , or pursued them logically
train/116_648_001_03_34.png , than the person of whom we are here speaking .
train/116_648_001_03_35.png H p . xliii
train/116_648_001_03_36.png The detail of this would then , that mere change of time and place made no
train/116_648_001_03_37.png change in the character of the person , or of the system pursued . It appears by all ,
train/116_648_001_03_38.png that good faith passed for small nothing : that deceptions the most gross ,
train/116_648_001_03_39.png artifices unheard of in diplomatic proceedings , even practiced without
train/116_648_001_03_40.png shame or scruple . When a party was once engaged in a negotiation , &
train/116_648_001_03_41.png placed in a said situation in which he could no longer help himself ,
train/116_648_001_03_42.png it was in vain to expect that any regard would be paid to the professions
train/116_648_001_03_43.png in which the negotiation began , or to declarations which occurred in the course
train/116_648_001_03_44.png of it . Any old engagement was set aside , or any new one foisted in , as suited
train/116_648_001_03_45.png the wishes , original or incidental , which France happened to entertain .
train/116_648_001_03_46.png H . p . xlvi
train/116_648_001_03_47.png Such is the deplorable laxness of mankind , such the abject hommage
train/116_648_001_03_48.png which men are willing to pay to crimes attended with success , to wickedness
train/116_648_001_03_49.png united with power , that none of the acts committed at any time by the
train/116_648_001_03_50.png agents of the French government , seem at all to have hurt their reception
train/116_648_001_03_51.png in the world , either collectively or individually . Their oppressions & cruelties excite
train/116_648_001_03_52.png no indignation ; their low and scandalous frauds no contempt ; their treacheries
train/116_648_001_03_53.png no distrust . _

train/096_052_002_03_01.png If we look to see this rule observed by our Author , we shall be disap -
train/096_052_002_03_02.png It
train/096_052_002_03_03.png -pointed In this there is not much to wonder at . But it is not
train/096_052_002_03_04.png uncommon to observe the attention flag and by the time a numer
train/096_052_002_03_05.png ous train of species have been displayed let the true that is the
train/096_052_002_03_06.png originally assumed character of the genus slip insensibly out
train/096_052_002_03_07.png of the memory , and a spurious one steal into it ' s place . But _
train/096_052_002_03_08.png what is uncommon , is to find this falsification take place in
train/096_052_002_03_09.png the first instance : and to see a part of the generic character _
train/096_052_002_03_10.png wanting in the very first instance of all that is adduced . This
train/096_052_002_03_11.png however is the ease here .
train/096_052_002_03_12.png The reason is not difficult to percieve . The general character of
train/096_052_002_03_13.png Law was taken from that species which in truth is the only one
train/096_052_002_03_14.png that which our Author calls Municipal , the Law that a part of
train/096_052_002_03_15.png the persons in in a state make for the rest . Meantime it was this
train/096_052_002_03_16.png misfortune to come to the business already determined to find _
train/096_052_002_03_17.png some other sorts , and these from some fancied pre-eminence , were
train/096_052_002_03_18.png to be mentioned first . This being his predetermination There was
train/096_052_002_03_19.png but one thing his invention could do to help delude his judgment
train/096_052_002_03_20.png and that was , to find a word of such convenient obscurity , as
train/096_052_002_03_21.png might put a mask on the generic character so that the repug-
train/096_052_002_03_22.png -nances between the first species and those that were to follow _
train/096_052_002_03_23.png no
train/096_052_002_03_24.png might pass off unperceived . For this purpose a word could not
train/096_052_002_03_25.png be better calculated than the word " prescribed : " It might upon oc-
train/096_052_002_03_26.png -casion signify writing , speaking or any mode of utterance wherein

train/071_053_003_03_07.png r
train/071_053_003_03_08.png to appoint an extrao dinary punishment which could ap=

train/071_053_003_03_10.png r
train/071_053_003_03_11.png was a demand for it . The benefit produced by an extrao dinary
train/071_053_003_03_12.png provision for that purpose would hardly make up for the incon-
train/071_053_003_03_13.png -venience that might result from the addition such a provision
train/071_053_003_03_14.png voluminousness
train/071_053_003_03_15.png it would make to the voluminuousness and intricacy of the
train/071_053_003_03_16.png penal code : such a provision would hardly pay for its place in
train/071_053_003_03_17.png the catalogue of punishments .
train/071_053_003_03_18.png 3 . Another reason against applying extraodinary punishment
train/071_053_003_03_19.png in the case of domestic theft is their being subject to a
train/071_053_003_03_20.png In England the

train/116_631_002_02_05.png unquestionably though tacitly assumed in the hypothe-

train/116_631_002_02_07.png part some regard would be paid to the ruler of

train/116_631_002_02_09.png bankrupt to him , as Parliament has been made
train/116_631_002_02_10.png to me : and that after his proposal had been

train/115_076_001_02_20.png is not by any means a sufficient allowance for the expence

train/002_541_001_02_04.png seven
train/002_541_001_02_05.png been formed of it six distinguishable results must take place : _
train/002_541_001_02_06.png 1 . It must meet with purchasers to take it out in the way of issue . _
train/002_541_001_02_07.png 2 . And that at the price proposed to be put upon it .
train/002_541_001_02_08.png 3 . It must be received in circulation _
train/002_541_001_02_09.png 4 . _ And at that price _
train/002_541_001_02_10.png 5 . _ And with an addition proportioned each day to the amount of Interest
train/002_541_001_02_11.png due upon it .
train/002_541_001_02_12.png 6 . It must be depretiation proof : _ being current on the above footing
train/002_541_001_02_13.png and without discount not only at its birth but through every stage
train/002_541_001_02_14.png of its existence .
train/002_541_001_02_15.png 7 . Its currency must be universal : _ not confined to this or that
train/002_541_001_02_16.png description of persons but extending to all descriptions . _
train/002_541_001_02_17.png Of its pretensions to the above attributes some judgment may
train/002_541_001_02_18.png already have been formed from the preceding they will now

train/115_008_002_02_02.png Service , but on ordinary days at meal times or times
train/115_008_002_02_03.png of work : providing thereby a system of superin-
train/115_008_002_02_04.png -tendence , universal , unchargeable , and uninterrupt-
train/115_008_002_02_05.png -ed , the most effectual and indestructible of all secu-
train/115_008_002_02_06.png -rities against abuse .
train/115_008_002_02_07.png Such are the methods that have occurred to him
train/115_008_002_02_08.png for the accomplishing that identification of interest with
train/115_008_002_02_09.png duty , the effectuating of which in the person of the
train/115_008_002_02_10.png Governor , is declared to be one of the leading objects of
train/115_008_002_02_11.png the Penitentiary Act .
train/115_008_002_02_12.png The station of Jailor is not in common account
train/115_008_002_02_13.png a very elevated one : the addition of Contractor has
train/115_008_002_02_14.png not much tendency to raise it . He little dreamt , when
train/115_008_002_02_15.png he first launched into the subject , that he was to become
train/115_008_002_02_16.png a suitor , and perhaps in vain , for such an office . But
train/115_008_002_02_17.png inventions unpractised might be in want of the in-
train/115_008_002_02_18.png -ventor : and a situation , thus clipped of emoluments
train/115_008_002_02_19.png while it was loaded with obligations , might be in want
train/115_008_002_02_20.png of candidates . Penetrated therefore with the importance
train/115_008_002_02_21.png of the end , he would not suffer himself to see any
train/115_008_002_02_22.png thing unpleasant or discreditable in the means .

train/115_086_003_02_10.png Lords Commissioners and their Successors as follows . A compu-

train/115_086_003_02_13.png each year out of the said number of a thousand Prisoners
train/115_086_003_02_14.png living at the commencement of such year , taking for the
train/115_086_003_02_15.png sum total of
train/115_086_003_02_16.png standard the annual proportion of the deaths at the end of
train/115_086_003_02_17.png a year to that of persons living at the commencement of the
train/115_086_003_02_18.png said year , according to the London Bills of Mortality , and
train/115_086_003_02_19.png ' the calculations thereon grounded by the late Rev : d Dr Price .
train/115_086_003_02_20.png Such computation being made , the said Jeremy Bentham &
train/115_086_003_02_21.png his Successors shall at the end of each year be on the one
train/115_086_003_02_22.png hand be made Creditors to the amount of £100 for every death
train/115_086_003_02_23.png which in the course of the said year might according to such
train/115_086_003_02_24.png computation have been expected to take place among the said

train/115_086_003_02_29.png to be to the number of persons living at the commencement

train/072_066_002_03_01.png Of Idleness .
train/072_066_002_04_01.png is the pain of sympathy . This then is aleady an evil .
train/072_066_002_04_02.png If it be without their consent , it assumes necessarily the
train/072_066_002_04_03.png shape of some one or other of the offences against the pro :
train/072_066_002_04_04.png : perty of individuals ; it changes its nature and becomes
train/072_066_002_04_05.png an offence against individuals .
train/072_066_002_04_06.png Idleness then , when the result of choice and ac :
train/072_066_002_04_07.png : companied by indigence , is obviously a proper object
train/072_066_002_04_08.png of coercion . But is it the result of choice ? This
train/072_066_002_04_09.png is a fact which it is highly necessary should be as :
train/072_066_002_04_10.png : certained before the coercion is applied . All other
train/072_066_002_04_11.png species of delinquency have this in common that the
train/072_066_002_04_12.png depends
train/072_066_002_04_13.png avoiding them altogether depends upon the deliquent .
train/072_066_002_04_14.png This is not the case with idleness : since for a man to
train/072_066_002_04_15.png have employment , two parties must concur : himself
train/072_066_002_04_16.png to accept it , and somebody else to give it him . It is
train/072_066_002_04_17.png plain therefore that the Legislator before he can , with
train/072_066_002_04_18.png any degree of Justice , punish idleness , or before he can
train/072_066_002_04_19.png even be entitled to lament it as a misforturne , ought so to
train/072_066_002_04_20.png order matters that whosoever stands in need of employ
train/072_066_002_04_21.png : ment may be sure to meet with it . This can only
train/072_066_002_04_22.png be

train/071_183_004_04_01.png only be practised upon a chance opportunity for the sake of
train/071_183_004_04_02.png a small and transient Profit .
train/071_183_004_04_03.png In this respect , this offence stands upon nearly the footing
train/071_183_004_04_04.png with that of Cheating by false Weights and Measures : with this
train/071_183_004_04_05.png difference that the Offender is not likely to be so responsible in
train/071_183_004_04_06.png the former Case as in the latter . The Stock and Substance
train/071_183_004_04_07.png of the Tradesman who sells the produce of the labour of a mul=
train/071_183_004_04_08.png : titude of workmen , is in general much greater , than that of the
train/071_183_004_04_09.png workman whose dealings are confined to the produce of his
train/071_183_004_04_10.png own .
train/071_183_004_04_11.png Robbery being an Offence against Property and Person both
train/071_183_004_04_12.png is a much more mischievous offence than Theft or any Fraud upon
train/071_183_004_04_13.png Property or , in short , than any offence against Person and Property
train/071_183_004_04_14.png alone . It would therefore be a very mischievous measure to turn
train/071_183_004_04_15.png a Thief into a Robber . Such would be the case if the Punish=
train/071_183_004_04_16.png : ment for Theft were severer than that of Robbery . For these
train/071_183_004_04_17.png are Crimes that are apt constantly to come in competition ; crimes
train/071_183_004_04_18.png to the temptation of which the same person is apt to be exposed .

train/096_018_002_01_06.png by which alone , laws may be determined to
train/096_018_002_01_07.png be good , or bad : right , or wrong : he would have
train/096_018_002_01_08.png given the only clue , which can explain to

train/071_130_003_04_01.png or at the least the effects of them diminished by human ingenuity
train/071_130_003_04_02.png and prudence . To take the measures necessary for this purpose
train/071_130_003_04_03.png requires the political power as well as Scientific contrivance of
train/071_130_003_04_04.png the Sovereign or those who act under his authority . It requires
train/071_130_003_04_05.png certain [ + ]
train/071_130_003_04_06.png a system of political regulations to be made which will of
train/071_130_003_04_07.png course be different , according to the different calamities which
train/071_130_003_04_08.png they are calculated to obviate . Till these regulations are
train/071_130_003_04_09.png made , it will in most cases be difficult to say what par=
train/071_130_003_04_10.png : ticular acts have any particular tendency to promote
train/071_130_003_04_11.png any given article in the list of those calamities . Such of-
train/071_130_003_04_12.png -fences will most of them be in that case in which the motive
train/071_130_003_04_13.png for punishing exists not before the law is made . The law must
train/071_130_003_04_14.png be made before the acts which it prohibits can be seen clearly
train/071_130_003_04_15.png to be of pernicious tendency . As in these cases it will be impos=
train/071_130_003_04_16.png : sible to ascertain the description of the Offence until the regula-

train/071_130_003_04_18.png must be given before the mischievousness of the Offence can be
train/071_130_003_04_19.png estimated and the punishment of it determined . But these
train/071_130_003_04_20.png regulations are altogether dependent upon local considerations .
train/071_130_003_04_21.png It is evident therefore that no place can be allotted to them
train/071_130_003_04_22.png here .
train/071_130_003_04_23.png It may be of use however to take a cursory view of the ge=

train/116_607_001_03_03.png Separation however , even though carried to

train/116_607_001_03_05.png for reformation . To reformation , occupation is

train/116_607_001_03_10.png Inclosed space , for whatever purpose , is not

train/116_607_001_03_12.png expence if work be proposed to be done , it is
train/116_607_001_03_13.png necessary not only that work shall be done , but
train/116_607_001_03_14.png done in such quantity and such quality , as to
train/116_607_001_03_15.png equal the expence . It is in this way that the
train/116_607_001_03_16.png interests of reformation and those of economy
train/116_607_001_03_17.png are intimately blended and connected . Work of
train/116_607_001_03_18.png some sort or other , profitable or not profitable in

train/071_128_003_04_15.png during which interval a great deal of consequential damage may

train/115_086_004_02_02.png the sum which the said intended Governor will annually
train/115_086_004_02_03.png be made Creditor for upon the supposition of his receiving
train/115_086_004_02_04.png the said number of 1000 Prisoners : and as he will be made
train/115_086_004_02_05.png Debtor to the said amount of £100 for every one which du-
train/115_086_004_02_06.png -ring the said period shall actually have died , it follows that
train/115_086_004_02_07.png if 40 , as expected , shall have died , neither more nor less , he
train/115_086_004_02_08.png will have nothing either to receive or to pay : if , instead of
train/115_086_004_02_09.png 40 , 41 , then he will have to pay to the amount of £100 ; if
train/115_086_004_02_10.png instead of 40 , 39 , then he will have to receive to the said am-
train/115_086_004_02_11.png -ount . But £4000 for 1000 Prisoners is the same proportion
train/115_086_004_02_12.png as £4 for 1 Prisoner : it follows therefore that according to
train/115_086_004_02_13.png the above computation , £4 will be the premium for which such
train/115_086_004_02_14.png intended Governor will be to be made Creditor on account

train/115_086_004_02_18.png within the compass of a year reckoning from the said day :

train/071_182_001_05_05.png but then it is because there are scarce any good ones to be had :
train/071_182_001_05_06.png and such bad ones as are most current are not in any way

train/071_182_001_05_10.png Coin is of course examined with much more attention than a

train/071_156_002_04_01.png With mercantile Frauds the Case is different . Of the
train/071_156_002_04_02.png persons concerned in those Offences some , indeed a great
train/071_156_002_04_03.png number , probably the greater number , will be persons poss :
train/071_156_002_04_04.png : essed of a very small degree of responsibility : but a consi :
train/071_156_002_04_05.png : derable number will also be perfectly responsible : for against
train/071_156_002_04_06.png the temptation of fraud no rank of Traders is absolutely
train/071_156_002_04_07.png proof : and in the class of Traders are included persons of
train/071_156_002_04_08.png all degrees of responsibility from the very lowest to the
train/071_156_002_04_09.png very highest . On this account it seems improper to subject
train/071_156_002_04_10.png offenders of the highest rank , at all events , to such a degree
train/071_156_002_04_11.png of punishment , as those only of the lowest stand in need of .
train/071_156_002_04_12.png At the same time in mercantile frauds the improbity
train/071_156_002_04_13.png of intention is apt perhaps to be not quite so palpable as
train/071_156_002_04_14.png in theft ; and what perhaps is more to the purpose the
train/071_156_002_04_15.png rank and figure and reputation of the persons who are
train/071_156_002_04_16.png sometimes betrayed into offences of this kind serve in
train/071_156_002_04_17.png some degree to mitigate the natural infamy . It might on
train/071_156_002_04_18.png this account seem harsh and unpopular to subject them at
train/071_156_002_04_19.png all events to the same degree of factitious legal infamy .

train/116_294_001_03_01.png According to the account given by Captain Collins in the
train/116_294_001_03_02.png same paragraph , at the very time of giving this assurance , the
train/116_294_001_03_03.png intention was that it should not be fulfilled . For now it was
train/116_294_001_03_04.png that " it was understood " ( now for the first time , as already observed )
train/116_294_001_03_05.png " that a clause was to be inserted in all future contracts for
train/116_294_001_03_06.png " shipping for this country , subjecting the masters to certain
train/116_294_001_03_07.png " penalties , on certificates being received of their having brought
train/116_294_001_03_08.png " away any Convicts or other persons from the settlement without
train/116_294_001_03_09.png " the Governor ' s permission : and as it was not probable that many
train/116_294_001_03_10.png " of them would , on their return , refrain from the vices , or avoid
train/116_294_001_03_11.png " the society , of those companions who had been the causes of their
train/116_294_001_03_12.png " transportation to this country , not many could hope to obtain the
train/116_294_001_03_13.png " sanction of the governor for their return " . _ A promise was thus
train/116_294_001_03_14.png given to all - and this at the very time when it was understood _
train/116_294_001_03_15.png understood , not by those who received it , but only by those who
train/116_294_001_03_16.png gave it , that " not many " would ever receive the benefit of it . _
train/116_294_001_03_17.png No wonder : since in the bosom of the Governor there was this
train/116_294_001_03_18.png are
train/116_294_001_03_19.png dilemma for every one : _ you a bad man ? _ you would do mis-
train/116_294_001_03_20.png -chief elsewhere : are you a good man ? _ we can ' t spare you . It
train/116_294_001_03_21.png was by this last horn of the syllogism , that Bloodsworth was
train/116_294_001_03_22.png hung up _ the good Convict mentioned in No..3 . " As his loss
train/116_294_001_03_23.png " would be severely felt should he quit it " ( the Colony ) " while in
train/116_294_001_03_24.png hi " its infancy " therefore it was that he received what is
train/116_294_001_03_25.png called his freedom _ viz : an obligation to work for two years ,
train/116_294_001_03_26.png having for his recompence the not being starved . _
train/116_294_001_03_27.png To say nothing of the perfidy _ the wanton useless perfidy _
train/116_294_001_03_28.png there is in this business a sort of inconsistency which to me
train/116_294_001_03_29.png is most perfectly inexplicable . If guided by his own untutored &

train/073_056_001_03_11.png to the first
train/073_056_001_03_12.png I answer by no means by the judge . lest least we
train/073_056_001_03_13.png should have a taking which no common Man
train/073_056_001_03_14.png would deem such , as we have already a Breaking

train/073_056_001_03_18.png Thise point here to be decided involves no collateral

train/073_056_001_03_22.png The misfortune is that with regard to this , there

train/071_139_004_04_02.png Your adversary knowing this gets possession of
train/071_139_004_04_03.png the ring and destroys it . For according to the rule
train/071_139_004_04_04.png of judging which his malevolence suggests to him
train/071_139_004_04_05.png it may be very well worth his while to pay
train/071_139_004_04_06.png a guinea for the pleasure of exposing You to
train/071_139_004_04_07.png so great a mortification . If the case is that he
train/071_139_004_04_08.png sets the same ideal value on the ring that You

train/071_139_004_04_10.png having been beloved by him as well as by You ,
train/071_139_004_04_11.png so that instead of damaging or destroying it
train/071_139_004_04_12.png in such case
train/071_139_004_04_13.png he means to keep it , as an additional mo=

train/071_139_004_04_15.png he will have the pleasure of possessing the
train/071_139_004_04_16.png thing on which he sets so high a value .
train/071_139_004_04_17.png It is plain therefore that a punishment
train/071_139_004_04_18.png must be capable of being rendered very severe :
train/071_139_004_04_19.png in order to be able to surmount in all cases

train/027_029_001_02_18.png 4 .
train/027_029_001_02_19.png This is the case with every thing that is called Pleasure : to exist it _

train/116_074_001_02_02.png " with the reduction in the price of grain which had been ordered ,
train/116_074_001_02_03.png " presented petitions to the governor , in which they stated the various
train/116_074_001_02_04.png " hardships that for a considerable time past they had laboured
train/116_074_001_02_05.png " under , in the hope that he might be induced to receive the
train/116_074_001_02_06.png " crops of the present season at the usual price . Having taken
train/116_074_001_02_07.png " their petitions into consideration , he desired them to recollect , that
train/116_074_001_02_08.png " near four years since he had given them notice , that the high
train/116_074_001_02_09.png " price of grain could not be continued longer than that season ;
train/116_074_001_02_10.png " and though he had not any doubt of their having sustained
train/116_074_001_02_11.png " the losses which they represented , and they must be sensible he
train/116_074_001_02_12.png " had used every means in his power to remove and relieve
train/116_074_001_02_13.png " their misfortunes , yet his duty to government compelled him
train/116_074_001_02_14.png " to adhere to the reduction of which they complained . At the same
train/116_074_001_02_15.png " time he could not avoid observing , that some of these misfortunes
train/116_074_001_02_16.png " had in many instances proceeded from a want of that attention
train/116_074_001_02_17.png " to their own interest , which every man possessing common dis-
train/116_074_001_02_18.png - " cretion would have shewn ; many of them having parted with
train/116_074_001_02_19.png " their last bushel for the gratification of the moment , thereby re-
train/116_074_001_02_20.png -ducing their families to distress and nakedness .
train/116_074_001_02_21.png " He likewise informed them , that he had much pleasure
train/116_074_001_02_22.png " in finding that government had a serious intention , as early
train/116_074_001_02_23.png " as the public concerns of the nation would admit , of adminis-
train/116_074_001_02_24.png - " tering every possible relief , by supplying the inhabitants with
train/116_074_001_02_25.png " such necessaries and comforts as they might require at a moderate
train/116_074_001_02_26.png " price . He was , however , obliged to direct the commissary to
train/116_074_001_02_27.png " receive the grain of this season at the prices ordered by him
train/116_074_001_02_28.png " in the month of October . " _

train/116_074_001_02_31.png " on account , not only of their former heavy losses , but of the exorbitant prices of
train/116_074_001_02_32.png " all those necessaries of life which they required for paying their labourers , the
train/116_074_001_02_33.png " governor consented to receive the wheat only at the former price of ten

train/116_074_001_02_36.png " season . He also permitted a certain quantity of the wine & spirits

train/071_180_004_04_04.png is even more likely to fall upon the people of his own country ,
train/071_180_004_04_05.png than upon any person abroad . There is no Coin of any Country , but
train/071_180_004_04_06.png what some person or other of every Country may have some
train/071_180_004_04_07.png occasion to purchase . If then a Man in England , for example ,
train/071_180_004_04_08.png counterfeits French money it is probably in a view of exchang=

train/071_180_004_04_11.png Besides this it is for the reciprocal advantage of all

train/072_051_002_04_04.png the gain to be made by such a traffic is a motive that is more

train/072_051_002_04_17.png The degree of contenance or discontenance which

train/072_051_002_04_19.png upon the particular connections between the several states

train/072_051_002_04_22.png partly upon the reason that one ' s own state may have for

train/072_032_002_04_03.png Reasons .
train/072_032_002_04_04.png Defamation , it is true , is rather more likely to pro=
train/072_032_002_04_05.png : duce quarrels when delivered before a man ' s face than
train/072_032_002_04_06.png when behind his back ; particularly in proportion as it is
train/072_032_002_04_07.png accompanied by reproach : and this produces at any rate
train/072_032_002_04_08.png a present pain . But then on the other hand this is all
train/072_032_002_04_09.png the mischief it is likely to produce . A man in this
train/072_032_002_04_10.png case has the Opportunity of defending his Reputation
train/072_032_002_04_11.png the instant it is in danger . It is not absolutely certain
train/072_032_002_04_12.png indeed that his defence even in this case will be suc=

train/072_032_002_04_14.png himself of the imputation : it is however most probable :
train/072_032_002_04_15.png since by the supposition he defends himself with all

train/072_032_002_04_17.png the imputation is cast upon him behind his back he has

train/115_107_003_01_04.png Seeing it universally approved and applauded in these
train/115_107_003_01_05.png instances it would be matter of no small mortification
train/115_107_003_01_06.png to him to find it rejected in an instance in which at
train/115_107_003_01_07.png his own risk he has shewn so much anxiety to see it
train/115_107_003_01_08.png introduced . Should the Inventor of this species of

train/071_185_001_04_05.png is its tendency to distribute itself into small parcels and

train/116_606_001_03_06.png Space for prevention of disease is a most indis-

train/116_606_001_03_08.png improvement that has no particular reference to

train/116_606_001_03_10.png space for separation , space for working , may be
train/116_606_001_03_11.png stated as to the two characteristic features , so

train/116_606_001_03_22.png appears to apply in common , and with scarce
train/116_606_001_03_23.png any exception that I could observe , to all these

train/115_110_003_02_19.png any sort of satisfaction for these losses . Such are
train/115_110_003_02_20.png the circumstances under which Mr Ford ( surely for

train/072_048_003_04_04.png Correspondent to the term subject is the term Allegi=

train/116_619_001_03_09.png such improvements , that the penitentiary system
train/116_619_001_03_10.png in its most improved form has been consigned
train/116_619_001_03_11.png to " relinquishment " , and the authority that pre-

train/116_619_001_03_13.png intention ,
train/116_619_001_03_14.png It was not my original , my Lord , to have
train/116_619_001_03_15.png attempted giving Your Lordship on the present
train/116_619_001_03_16.png occasion any trouble on the subject of the official
train/116_619_001_03_17.png letter , to which the plan thus alluded to has
train/116_619_001_03_18.png been consigned : but , having gone thus far , it is
train/116_619_001_03_19.png becomes se necessary for me I fear to transcribe
train/116_619_001_03_20.png a part of it at least , on pain of seeing the above
train/116_619_001_03_21.png statement exposed to the suspicion of being ground-
train/116_619_001_03_22.png -less , and perhaps as to the charge of being un-
train/116_619_001_03_23.png -intelligible . The letter then to which the deter-
train/116_619_001_03_24.png -mination in question , or at any rate the ex-
train/116_619_001_03_25.png -pression of it was consigned , bears date the
train/116_619_001_03_26.png 14th of October 1799 : Signature that of the Duke of

train/116_641_001_02_01.png That recommendation by subordinates should
train/116_641_001_02_02.png be taken without enquiry is natural enough , customary
train/116_641_001_02_03.png enough , certainly not illegal ; and so far without
train/116_641_001_02_04.png dispute not culpable . In the present instance , for
train/116_641_001_02_05.png judging of the propriety of the recommendation , or
train/116_641_001_02_06.png of the views which gave it birth , two points may
train/116_641_001_02_07.png afford some light : the one antecedent to the ap-
train/116_641_001_02_08.png -pointment ; the other subsequent : the person
train/116_641_001_02_09.png recommended for the office , & his conduct when
train/116_641_001_02_10.png invested with it .
train/116_641_001_02_11.png The gentleman who comes out of the pocket is
train/116_641_001_02_12.png without dispute the friend of the wearer of the pocket
train/116_641_001_02_13.png out of which he comes . - What are his other titles ?
train/116_641_001_02_14.png To me , who neither am known nor know , he is known
train/116_641_001_02_15.png by nothing but a name : nor even by name shall
train/116_641_001_02_16.png he be spoken of by me . In matters of this kind -
train/116_641_001_02_17.png where public money is thus disposed of - in my
train/116_641_001_02_18.png estimate at least which never looks for any thing
train/116_641_001_02_19.png more than human in the bulk of men - not the
train/116_641_001_02_20.png receiver , but the donor- I had almost used another
train/116_641_001_02_21.png word - is to blame . What is on record- what is pub-
train/116_641_001_02_22.png -lic - may be mentioned without reserve : & it is
train/116_641_001_02_23.png quite sufficient for the purpose . Lord Pelham , on
train/116_641_001_02_24.png coming into office , finds him a Police Magistrate ,
train/116_641_001_02_25.png at £400 a year . By one of Lord Pelham ' s two exertions ,
train/116_641_001_02_26.png to this £400 is added another £100 , God knows why

train/116_055_001_02_01.png No 1 P . 136 . Decr 1790 . The harvest which was begun in the last ,
train/116_055_001_02_02.png was completed in this month . In the abundance that was expected ,
train/116_055_001_02_03.png every one was disappointed ; for , owing to a most tedious and un-
train/116_055_001_02_04.png -fortunate drought during ten months , the wheat did not turn
train/116_055_001_02_05.png out more than one third of what , from the quantity of ground
train/116_055_001_02_06.png sown with that grain , there was a reasonable expectation of its
train/116_055_001_02_07.png producing , had the season been moderately favourable . This was the
train/116_055_001_02_08.png more seriously felt , as at one time a hope was entertained of
train/116_055_001_02_09.png reaping grain sufficient to supply the colony with bread for two
train/116_055_001_02_10.png years .
train/116_055_001_02_11.png No 2 . P . 202 . March 1799 . The settlement was at this time much
train/116_055_001_02_12.png in want of many necessary articles of life ; and when these were
train/116_055_001_02_13.png brought by speculators and traders who occasionally touched there ,
train/116_055_001_02_14.png they demanded more than 500 per cent above what the same
train/116_055_001_02_15.png articles could have been sent out for from England , with every
train/116_055_001_02_16.png addition of freight , insurance , &c . They saw the wants of the
train/116_055_001_02_17.png colony and availed themselves of its necessities . _
train/116_055_001_02_18.png No 3 P . 210 . May 1799 . A quantity of fresh pork having been for
train/116_055_001_02_19.png some time secured into the store , there were found at this period six
train/116_055_001_02_20.png months salt provisions remaining ; which , without this supply would
train/116_055_001_02_21.png have been all consumed , and the colony left without animal food ,
train/116_055_001_02_22.png save in the article of live stock , a resource on which it could not
train/116_055_001_02_23.png have been prudent to have touched as a supply , except in a case
train/116_055_001_02_24.png of the last necessity . _
train/116_055_001_02_25.png Every encouragement was given to the curing of pork upon Norfolk Island ;
train/116_055_001_02_26.png but the casks in which the salt meat was sent from England were in
train/116_055_001_02_27.png general so extremely feeble by the time they arrived , that scarcely one in a
train/116_055_001_02_28.png hundred was fit for that purpose a second time . Could any timber , fit
train/116_055_001_02_29.png for this use , have been found in the country , yet a supply of hoops and
train/116_055_001_02_30.png salt pans would have been necessary ; and unless it was cured in the winter
train/116_055_001_02_31.png season , and the method observed by Captain Cook was practised at Norfolk Island ,
train/116_055_001_02_32.png it remained a doubt whether it could be accomplished to any considerable extent .
train/116_055_001_02_33.png The price of fresh pork having been raised in consequence of the failure
train/116_055_001_02_34.png of the late harvest , as a temporary relief to those who had suffered by that
train/116_055_001_02_35.png misfortune , the commissary was , at the close of this month , directed to re-
train/116_055_001_02_36.png -turn to the price formerly established , viz . nine-pence per pound .
train/116_055_001_02_37.png The state of the public stores with respect to salt provisions
train/116_055_001_02_38.png having been carefully examined , it became necessary to make a small

train/072_049_001_04_06.png remains contributory to its well-being and subject to its
train/072_049_001_04_07.png authority it has the same reason nearly for affording
train/072_049_001_04_08.png protection to him as to a native . In this point of view
train/072_049_001_04_09.png it is as much affected by the primary mischief of the in=

train/072_049_001_04_11.png affected by the secondary mischief as if he were a native .
train/072_049_001_04_12.png to
train/072_049_001_04_13.png It will of course therefore give him the same degree of
train/072_049_001_04_14.png protection as to a native ; and unless in the particular
train/072_049_001_04_15.png case of a privileged person the state of which he is a member
train/072_049_001_04_16.png will hardly expect he should have a greater .
train/072_049_001_04_17.png The same measures which serve to provide only for
train/072_049_001_04_18.png the internal tranquillity of the state when committed a=

train/073_067_001_03_02.png all those Inlets to Impunity under equal guilt , which
train/073_067_001_03_03.png an acute and interested Examination of the subsisting
train/073_067_001_03_04.png Doctrine might discover .
train/073_067_001_03_05.png But here again another Question
train/073_067_001_03_06.png may occur ( for it has already occurred to Writers +
train/073_067_001_03_07.png in other Words ) whether the presence of this Consciousness
train/073_067_001_03_08.png is to be left to the Jury , ( to whom I refer the Cognizance
train/073_067_001_03_09.png of it without Hesitation for the Reasons mentioned
train/073_067_001_03_10.png under the word " Taking " ) to infer without further
train/073_067_001_03_11.png without further rule
train/073_067_001_03_12.png Rule by their Discretion ; or whether any such points

train/073_067_001_03_15.png capable of being number ' d & ascertained ?
train/073_067_001_03_16.png I have taken no small pains to find an
train/073_067_001_03_17.png Answer to this Question , and the Results is that I
train/073_067_001_03_18.png conceive they are reducible to one of these 4 viz :
train/073_067_001_03_19.png 1st . Concealment of the Act of taking 2d Conceal-

train/116_400_001_03_14.png for confining and employing in hard labour , person convicted
train/116_400_001_03_15.png of transportable and other Crimes . _
train/116_400_001_03_16.png I understand the objects of those Acts to be , that such
train/116_400_001_03_17.png Penitentiary Houses should be used principally as receptacles
train/116_400_001_03_18.png for such transportable Convicts , as the several gaols of the

train/116_400_001_03_22.png With respect to the probably number of transportable Convicts ,
train/116_400_001_03_23.png no safer rule can be adopted , than by taking the greatest num-

train/116_400_001_03_27.png As to other Convicts , it will depend on the opinion of
train/116_400_001_03_28.png the Judges who try them , what number of them it may be
train/116_400_001_03_29.png proper to confine in the Panopticon : it is impossible to ascer-

train/116_400_001_03_31.png but I incline to think it would be very inexpedient to move

train/115_112_003_02_01.png Article 18 . Mr Bentham submits to Mr
train/115_112_003_02_02.png Ford ' s Proposal in regard to the excluding out of
train/115_112_003_02_03.png the Estimate all ages under ten years : but he flatters
train/115_112_003_02_04.png himself Mr Ford will not think it unreasonable
train/115_112_003_02_05.png that the exclusion should be suspended for the first
train/115_112_003_02_06.png year , considering the dangers to health that threaten
train/115_112_003_02_07.png an institution of this sort at its outset , when per-
train/115_112_003_02_08.png -sons of that description are received in such large
train/115_112_003_02_09.png multitudes at once from all the Jails in the King-

train/115_112_003_02_12.png into an unseasoned building : dangers against which
train/115_112_003_02_13.png the best professional advice seconded by the strictest
train/115_112_003_02_14.png attention may be no adequate defense .
train/115_112_003_02_15.png In the Hulks under Mr Campbel ' s care the
train/115_112_003_02_16.png mortality was very considerable at first as appears
train/115_112_003_02_17.png by Howard ' s Books , and by the Reports made
train/115_112_003_02_18.png to the House of Commons . At Portsmouth or

train/115_112_003_02_20.png between 1/6 and 1/5 of the whole number , as appears

train/071_163_003_04_09.png As to the mere Act of Coining considered by itself
train/071_163_003_04_10.png the chance of convicting a man of it upon direct proof is compa=

train/071_163_003_04_14.png : ticular nature of the act which , however mischievous it
train/071_163_003_04_15.png may be in its design and consequences , yet not being the
train/071_163_003_04_16.png very act from which the mischief immediately takes its

train/071_185_004_04_01.png Quest VII . Why the Punishment in this Case may
train/071_185_004_04_02.png be fixed ,
train/071_185_004_04_03.png Reason
train/071_185_004_04_04.png Because the mischief is to be estimated in this Case
train/071_185_004_04_05.png not from the particular consequences of any single Act , but from
train/071_185_004_04_06.png the general consequences of the obnoxious habit . See Quest V .
train/071_185_004_04_07.png It can answer therefore no purpose to make the pu=
train/071_185_004_04_08.png : nishment rise and fall with the profit upon any single
train/071_185_004_04_09.png offence . The profit which the punishment must be made
train/071_185_004_04_10.png to outweigh is the profit not upon the particular Act , but
train/071_185_004_04_11.png upon the habitual Practice . Now the quantum of the for=
train/071_185_004_04_12.png : mer is susceptible of direct proof . But this is not the case
train/071_185_004_04_13.png with the latter . It can be appraised no otherwise than by a
train/071_185_004_04_14.png random calculation . This calculation may be the same for
train/071_185_004_04_15.png all cases . It may therefore as well be made by the Legis=
train/071_185_004_04_16.png : lator as by the Judge .
train/071_185_004_04_17.png Quest . VIII . Why the indelible Stigma is here
train/071_185_004_04_18.png employed ,
train/071_185_004_04_19.png Reasons .
train/071_185_004_04_20.png 1 . Because the infamy will not be so intolerable in this

train/071_184_001_03_01.png Of Frauds relative to the Coin .
train/071_184_001_04_01.png of time cannot of himself turn to any thing . His habits of Skill
train/071_184_001_04_02.png and honest Industry , if he ever had any , are obliterated ; his
train/071_184_001_04_03.png reputation , if he ever had any , is gone . Frighten him from
train/071_184_001_04_04.png practising Theft , he will have nothing left for it but to
train/071_184_001_04_05.png turn Robber .
train/071_184_001_04_06.png Between Coining and Robbery the case is different . A
train/071_184_001_04_07.png man ' s being in the habit of Coining may in general be looked
train/071_184_001_04_08.png upon as a presumption of his possessing some honest Art from
train/071_184_001_04_09.png which this illicit practise is only an occasional deviation , and
train/071_184_001_04_10.png to which if forced back by salutary terrors , he may at any
train/071_184_001_04_11.png time return . A button maker or silversmith who has taken
train/071_184_001_04_12.png to Coining , although he should cease to coin , may continue
train/071_184_001_04_13.png to subsist : he has only to confine himself to the proper bu=
train/071_184_001_04_14.png : siness of a silversmith or a button maker . On such a per=
train/071_184_001_04_15.png : son therefore a punishment greater than even that for Rob=
train/071_184_001_04_16.png : bery may have its effect without driving him into the prac=
train/071_184_001_04_17.png : tice of the more atrocious offence : instead of driving him on to Rob=
train/071_184_001_04_18.png : bery it may only drive him back to Button making .

train/073_063_001_03_01.png common Sense & not of Law to say , if this was a
train/073_063_001_03_02.png carrying away & not a taking , what a taking was ; and
train/073_063_001_03_03.png that such an one if asked in any of these Cases ,
train/073_063_001_03_04.png Did the Thief carry
train/073_063_001_03_05.png Is the Man carrying the Goods away ? would either
train/073_063_001_03_06.png be apt to say , no ; take them he did , but he was
train/073_063_001_03_07.png seized before he could carry them away . |||
train/073_063_001_03_08.png On the negative side I find neither
train/073_063_001_03_09.png Decision nor Opinion .
train/073_063_001_03_10.png I have drawn the Line of Consummation
train/073_063_001_03_11.png at this stage of the guilty Process , because ' twas at
train/073_063_001_03_12.png this that I thought it would be most conspicuous
train/073_063_001_03_13.png and least liable to Controversy . If not , let there be
train/073_063_001_03_14.png supposed some Period posterior to and distinct from the
train/073_063_001_03_15.png " taking " and let it be called the " carrying away " #
train/073_063_001_03_16.png Now carrying away must be from some place
train/073_063_001_03_17.png by
train/073_063_001_03_18.png to some other : but to settle the explanatory Aphorisms
train/073_063_001_03_19.png the Limits between these two Places in every Case that
train/073_063_001_03_20.png might occur would lead into endless Difficulties and
train/073_063_001_03_21.png Disenssions ; and to leave it to the Jury in every
train/073_063_001_03_22.png Case without any such Direction would induce great
train/073_063_001_03_23.png Fluctuation of in & Uncertainty in the Decisions

train/073_069_001_02_01.png THEFT
train/073_069_001_03_01.png For Examples in Proof of this , to avoid tedious
train/073_069_001_03_02.png Details , I must be content to refer myself to the
train/073_069_001_03_03.png Reader ' s Imagination .
train/073_069_001_03_04.png The inserting Aphorisms concerning them
train/073_069_001_03_05.png in the popular Code would have a mischievous
train/073_069_001_03_06.png Consequence , if any ; in as much as it would
train/073_069_001_03_07.png serve to point out to Malefactors the precautions
train/073_069_001_03_08.png conducive to their Security .
train/073_069_001_03_09.png 4th Without the Consent of him who
train/073_069_001_03_10.png has , or of any acting one on his Behalf
train/073_069_001_03_11.png This is inserted for the sake of distinguishing
train/073_069_001_03_12.png the Crime in Question as well from Embezzlement
train/073_069_001_03_13.png as from the several Kinds of Frauds .
train/073_069_001_03_14.png How these are respectively distinguished from
train/073_069_001_03_15.png each other will be seen in its proper place .

train/073_069_001_03_18.png I believe this Expression will be deemed less
train/073_069_001_03_19.png equivocal than another which I had under Consideration ;
train/073_069_001_03_20.png viz : " converting it to his own use " which latter
train/073_069_001_03_21.png might in strictness perhaps be used of a Man

train/071_162_001_04_02.png In the mention of Frauds relative to the Coin the
train/071_162_001_04_03.png act
train/071_162_001_04_04.png Act of Coining naturally takes the lead : but it is the uttering
train/071_162_001_04_05.png bad
train/071_162_001_04_06.png of base Coin , the obtaining things of a certain Value in return
train/071_162_001_04_07.png for a thing pretended to be of equal but which in fact is of
train/071_162_001_04_08.png less Value , that produces all the Mischief .
train/071_162_001_04_09.png Coining is a species of Forgery . The impression given
train/071_162_001_04_10.png to a piece of coin is designed to answer the purpose of a dis=
train/071_162_001_04_11.png : course to this effect ; " I the Officer in this case appointed by

train/116_295_001_03_01.png two non-expirees . These four fugitives were discovered by smoking
train/116_295_001_03_02.png the ship , an operation , for which the consent of the master ( for
train/116_295_001_03_03.png so it is particularly stated ) had been obtained . Of the non-expi-
train/116_295_001_03_04.png -rees it is stated that they had not yet served the full period
train/116_295_001_03_05.png but
train/116_295_001_03_06.png of their sentences . From this statement it seemed reasonable to
train/116_295_001_03_07.png inferr that even these , had they returned to England , would not
train/116_295_001_03_08.png have been landed there till after the day at which they had
train/116_295_001_03_09.png a right to land on British ground . Be this as it may ,
train/116_295_001_03_10.png thus much is our doubt , that by this order the assurance
train/116_295_001_03_11.png given in the preceding one of August 1792 was compleatly
train/116_295_001_03_12.png violated : and that in respect of the faculty of leaving the
train/116_295_001_03_13.png Colony , the condition of those who had a right , and those
train/116_295_001_03_14.png who had not a right , was the same : the same under the
train/116_295_001_03_15.png eye , and by the act of that very Governor , by whom the exist-
train/116_295_001_03_16.png -ence of the right had not seven months before , been noticed
train/116_295_001_03_17.png and recognized so that , by his own shewing , he kept them
train/116_295_001_03_18.png there in defiance of the law .
train/116_295_001_03_19.png N . 12 ( p . 283 ) 24th April 1793 . A second opportunity for ma-
train/116_295_001_03_20.png -nifesting the sincerity of the assurance , and the manifestation is
train/116_295_001_03_21.png of the same kind . " But few Convicts " ( meaning Expirees , says
train/116_295_001_03_22.png Captain Collins ) " were allowed to quit the Colony in these ships :
train/116_295_001_03_23.png by which it is evident that it was want of permission on the
train/116_295_001_03_24.png part of the governor , and not want of room or any other
train/116_295_001_03_25.png faculty that prevented the numbers from being greater . The
train/116_295_001_03_26.png ships were two . On another occasion in Nov . 1794 it appears
train/116_295_001_03_27.png that the number of Convicts received on board two ships only
train/116_295_001_03_28.png ( the Endeavour and the Fancy ) had been near an hundred + :

train/096_003_002_01_02.png what are called causes & effects in the
train/096_003_002_01_03.png natural world : and therefore that
train/096_003_002_01_04.png as in the latter case from this expe :
train/096_003_002_01_05.png : rience we are allowed to infer , that
train/096_003_002_01_06.png such a cause will produce such an
train/096_003_002_01_07.png effect , so in the moral world , we
train/096_003_002_01_08.png &
train/096_003_002_01_09.png may infer , that at all times the
train/096_003_002_01_10.png among all men , the same motives ,
train/096_003_002_01_11.png & the same circumstances supposed ,
train/096_003_002_01_12.png the same actions will follow . Even
train/096_003_002_01_13.png this will not be sufficient to justify our
train/096_003_002_01_14.png Author ' s assertion that man must
train/096_003_002_01_15.png inevitably & in all things obey
train/096_003_002_01_16.png the Will of his Creator , unless he
train/096_003_002_01_17.png supposes too that the Creator has
train/096_003_002_01_18.png placed every man in such circum-
train/096_003_002_01_19.png : stances , that the motives to obedience
train/096_003_002_01_20.png must be always present , and always

train/096_003_002_01_23.png force _ To what purpose a System
train/096_003_002_01_24.png of Laws ? And if he does not suppose this ,
train/096_003_002_01_25.png it is absurd to apply the term of Law to motion
train/096_003_002_01_26.png gravitation & , in the same sense as he
train/096_003_002_01_27.png applies it to the moral conduct of an intelligent

train/115_111_001_02_01.png upon the occasion , it only gives Mr Bentham
train/115_111_001_02_02.png for his Penitentiary Plan , and that for a single
train/115_111_001_02_03.png year in one case , and for two years in another ,
train/115_111_001_02_04.png what it is now giving to Mr Campbell , and
train/115_111_001_02_05.png would continue to be giving to him otherwise , for
train/115_111_001_02_06.png his Hulk Plan .
train/115_111_001_02_07.png Mr Ford assumes , as it was very natural for him
train/115_111_001_02_08.png to do , that of the £27,000 , £15,000 was for the
train/115_111_001_02_09.png Building , since £15,000 is the difference between the
train/115_111_001_02_10.png £27,000 ( the sum demanded for the first year / and
train/115_111_001_02_11.png £12,000 ( the sum demanded for every subsequent year
train/115_111_001_02_12.png for the 1000 Prisoners / : and an inference equally natural
train/115_111_001_02_13.png was , that , as Government had paid that sum once
train/115_111_001_02_14.png for the Building to Mr Bentham , it should not
train/115_111_001_02_15.png have to pay that sum over again to his Represen-
train/115_111_001_02_16.png -tatives . But no such line of distinction was ever
train/115_111_001_02_17.png drawn on either side till now . Mr Bentham ' s pro-
train/115_111_001_02_18.png -position was _ " Land with a fixed price to it has

train/115_110_001_03_10.png committed to his care , above the stipulated number
train/115_110_001_03_11.png of 1000 , for the express purpose of providing an

train/115_110_001_03_14.png would be fairer to let that matter be referred to

train/116_244_001_01_07.png the wisdom , if good in any one place , will be act

train/071_112_001_04_08.png Reasons
train/071_112_001_04_09.png 1 . Because as the profit as well as mischief of the Offence

train/071_181_002_04_08.png a question altogether immaterial with a view to practice . If
train/071_181_002_04_09.png there be any one single man in the nation who will accept
train/071_181_002_04_10.png the counterfeit Coin , the mischief is as effectually incurred and
train/071_181_002_04_11.png that mischief is as great , as if there were ten thousand who
