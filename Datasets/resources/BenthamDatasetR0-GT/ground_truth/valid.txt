valid/116_649_001_03_03.png -tators against atrocious crimes , the gravest and most dignified moral
valid/116_649_001_03_04.png principle which the God of Justice has implanted in the human heart ,
valid/116_649_001_03_05.png that of which the dread is the only restraint on the actions of powerful
valid/116_649_001_03_06.png criminals , & of which the promulgation is the only punishment
valid/116_649_001_03_07.png that can be inflicted on them . It is a restraint which ought
valid/116_649_001_03_08.png not to be weakened _ it is a punishment no good man
valid/116_649_001_03_09.png can desire to mitigate .
valid/116_649_001_03_10.png H . 166 I hope I may venture to say , that no English assembly need

valid/116_649_001_03_14.png there is also a much more sacred decorum due to virtue +
valid/116_649_001_03_15.png to human nature , which would be outraged & trampled under

valid/116_618_001_03_01.png Would Your Lordship have supposed it ? - It is
valid/116_618_001_03_02.png upon the very merits _ the acknowledged or at any
valid/116_618_001_03_03.png rate the alledged merits , of the Penitentiary system ,
valid/116_618_001_03_04.png in these its less perfect forms , that the hostility
valid/116_618_001_03_05.png to it in its more perfect form has grounded itself .
valid/116_618_001_03_06.png So well has the system succeeded in this and
valid/116_618_001_03_07.png that Count Country , that for that very reason there
valid/116_618_001_03_08.png is to be none for England : so well has it suc-

valid/116_618_001_03_11.png be suffered to shew itself upon a large one : _
valid/116_618_001_03_12.png so well have the existing prisons succeeded at
valid/116_618_001_03_13.png an enormous rate of expence , that for that
valid/116_618_001_03_14.png very reason a still better prison is not to
valid/116_618_001_03_15.png be suffered to be built at a tenth a fifteenth
valid/116_618_001_03_16.png or a twentieth part of that expence . So peremptory
valid/116_618_001_03_17.png was the determination to cover the country with
valid/116_618_001_03_18.png prisons unthought of by Parliament , that
valid/116_618_001_03_19.png it is for that very reason it was determined not
valid/116_618_001_03_20.png to have the one prison , that had so long ago and

valid/073_074_002_03_04.png It had been well if instead of losing his
valid/073_074_002_03_05.png Labour in these unnecessary Distinctions , he had

valid/071_192_002_05_02.png [ ( a ) Only ] I am speaking all along , it is to be remembered , of the case where
valid/071_192_002_05_03.png the property is not visible . Where it is there is no need either of Imprison
valid/071_192_002_05_04.png ment or examination .
valid/096_098_003_01_01.png such
valid/096_098_003_01_02.png an one enacted by any Legislator .
valid/096_098_003_01_03.png In the former Case , it will be either kept
valid/096_098_003_01_04.png or broken : if broken , there is an Unhappiness
valid/096_098_003_01_05.png produced by the Punishment [ which forms ] the
valid/096_098_003_01_06.png sanction : if kept , men are kept from doing what
valid/096_098_003_01_07.png they have a Mind to do : now to be kept from
valid/096_098_003_01_08.png doing what one has a Mind to do , is Unhappiness . ||
valid/096_098_003_01_09.png To instance at once the strongest Case that
valid/096_098_003_01_10.png can be put in Contradiction ; the Case of a Law
valid/096_098_003_01_11.png Now
valid/096_098_003_01_12.png against Murder : laying out of Consideration for a
valid/096_098_003_01_13.png moment the Unhappiness it prevents to a Person
valid/096_098_003_01_14.png who without it would be murder ' d , his Friends , &
valid/096_098_003_01_15.png the Community , as likewise at the long run to
valid/096_098_003_01_16.png the Person who would murder ; it is evident it
valid/096_098_003_01_17.png produces for the present a Quantity of Unhappiness
valid/096_098_003_01_18.png in the latter person _ the Unhappiness concomitant
valid/096_098_003_01_19.png on Restraint _ the Unhappiness of being obliged

valid/115_107_001_01_16.png It applies to this purpose the united powers of

valid/115_107_001_01_19.png that , so far as punishment is concerned , it produces its
valid/115_107_001_01_20.png effect with that degree of certainty with which nothing

valid/115_065_004_02_12.png And Whereas in particular the price of bricks hath within
valid/115_065_004_02_13.png the said period undergone an enhancement by means of a

valid/115_065_004_02_17.png delay from whence such encrease of charge hath accrued hath

valid/073_054_001_03_10.png In a Word the Import of the Term Theft with
valid/073_054_001_03_11.png it ' s Conjugates above mentioned is coextensive with
valid/073_054_001_03_12.png the Moral Idea : Larceny with the Legal .
valid/073_054_001_03_13.png This Distinction is far from being steadily
valid/073_054_001_03_14.png observed : Writers every now & then stretching the
valid/073_054_001_03_15.png Import of the Word Larceny to a Synonimity with
valid/073_054_001_03_16.png hence it is that
valid/073_054_001_03_17.png Theft ; by which means Things are brought to that

valid/115_011_002_02_30.png -dinary culture of extraordinary talents is not
valid/115_011_002_02_31.png in this point of view worth mentioning : it
valid/115_011_002_02_32.png would be for his own advantage to give them

valid/071_181_001_03_01.png Of Frauds relative to the Coin .
valid/071_181_001_04_01.png only Coin which a man is obliged to accept in payment : unless
valid/071_181_001_04_02.png it be such foreign Coin as the State has thought proper to adopt :
valid/071_181_001_04_03.png which puts it upon the footing of domestic . On this account it may
valid/071_181_001_04_04.png be thought that the counterfeiting of the former is more mischie=
valid/071_181_001_04_05.png : vous than the counterfeiting of the latter . But this objection ,
valid/071_181_001_04_06.png when examined , will be found to be of little force . A piece
valid/071_181_001_04_07.png of domestic Coin , if it happens to be counterfeit , he is no more
valid/071_181_001_04_08.png obliged to take , than he is to take counterfeit foreign Coin .
valid/071_181_001_04_09.png When a piece of counterfeit domestic Coin then is tendered to him ,
valid/071_181_001_04_10.png if he suspects it , measures are taken , I suppose , by the Laws of
valid/071_181_001_04_11.png all Countries , to give him a right to put it to the test at his
valid/071_181_001_04_12.png peril ; so that if it turns out not to be good , the loss falls not
valid/071_181_001_04_13.png upon him but upon the tenderer . This obligation to accept is a
valid/071_181_001_04_14.png circumstance that applies not in one case out of ten thousand .
valid/071_181_001_04_15.png In ordinary Cases where a man accepts money , it is not that
valid/071_181_001_04_16.png he is forced but that he chuses so to do . The question then upon
valid/071_181_001_04_17.png which the mischief turns is whether there be any case in
valid/071_181_001_04_18.png which a man would have an adequate inducement to accept
valid/071_181_001_04_19.png of the counterfeit foreign Coin , if he did not suspect it so to be .

valid/116_287_002_02_17.png In this most instructive paragraph , Your Lordship
valid/116_287_002_02_18.png sees at once , the monstrous , yet in that quarter but too frequent ,

valid/071_166_001_04_05.png There remains nothing now but to make provision
valid/071_166_001_04_06.png for settling the disputes that are apt to arise concerning the weight
valid/071_166_001_04_07.png and legitimacy of money , where the money itself is suspected ,
valid/071_166_001_04_08.png but either no suspicion at all is entertained of the person who

valid/071_166_001_04_11.png relatives to this head do not indeed strictly speaking belong to
valid/071_166_001_04_12.png the criminal branch ; but as they are intimately connected with
valid/071_166_001_04_13.png a subject that belongs properly to that branch , and may be
valid/071_166_001_04_14.png dispatched in a small compass , it may not be amiss to insert
valid/071_166_001_04_15.png them here . The tenor of these Provisions may be as follows :

valid/073_073_001_03_12.png It is not true that the word " taking "
valid/073_073_001_03_13.png implies any such Thing . The ordinary
valid/073_073_001_03_14.png Conceptions concerning the Offence of Men

valid/116_078_001_02_04.png " they demanded more than five hundred per cent above what the
